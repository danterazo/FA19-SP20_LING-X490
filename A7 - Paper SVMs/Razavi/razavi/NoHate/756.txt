Hi all. I am a bit confused about the different types of batteries available and which type ( s ) are compatible with the 800si. Right now , I just use standard lithium batteries and dont know if I would be better off using a different type. Could someone do a quick run-down of the pros and cons of the different battery types , and what would work well in an 800si ? Thanks. Viken
