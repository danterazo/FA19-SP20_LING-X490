But hey , they are free. Strange , though , that nobody has bothered with hacking some GNUish Fortran compiler yet. Anybody knows of current projects ? There is g77. There is no g90 yet , mainly due to the huge expense. Yes , and even g77 " only " uses the f2c converter. Would you like to volunteer to contribute ? I am afraid I cant. I have never done something like that before and would hardly find the time to produce anything reasonable , unless maybe for very small and very concrete parts. Gruss , Henry
