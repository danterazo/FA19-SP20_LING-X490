I would handle the situation exactly as Barbara Jewel Hopson is , with the exception of contacting the client myself. Linda , I would have done the same , most likely. I dont think I would have filed the lawsuit , though. Just chalked it up to a bad choice in employer. I have been to a number of interviews were illegal questions were asked. Instead of filing lawsuits or complaints or anything , I just learned from the experience and generally decided that was an employer I wouldnt want to work for anyway. Carol American by birth. Southern by the grace of God .
