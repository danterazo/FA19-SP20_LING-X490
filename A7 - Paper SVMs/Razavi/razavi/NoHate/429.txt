My 11 YO son is pretty artsy and is interested in taking pictures. I want to buy him a modestly priced camera. He can be reasonably careful , but does have a younger brother who sometimes gets into his stuff. I am thinking about a used 35 mm SLR. Does anybody have any suggestions ? Larry Berk I started letting my 11 year old use my old Canon FTb last year , with supervision , and with good results. It is a match needle system that is easy to learn how to use even if you do not fully understand f stops and depth of field. He has used a point and shoot for several years and wanted something that looked as " cool " as my cameras. I am a manual camera nut and whether he sticks with manual cameras or not , he will at least have learned to use one. It was a great thrill for him to get back his first set of slides ! You can get a used FTb with 50 mm lens for 100 - 120 on E-bay. The FTb has a good reputation ( in my opinion ) . Tim Phipps
