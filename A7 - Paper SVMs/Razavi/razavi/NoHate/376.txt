On Sun , 03 Oct 1999 -0400 , Matt Ruff / Lisa Gold # 3 ) I cant get over PKDs ability to weave lots of minute plot threads together into a unified whole. Is this typical of his work ? I think his best is probably " A Scanner Darkly. " Others worth checking out are " Time Out of Joint , " " Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep , " and " Ubik. " I have never read any PKD I actively disliked ; " A Scanner Darkly " , " Electric Sheep " and " Ubik " ( which was turned into an AWFUL computer game , believe it or not ; I got it for $ 4 and I think I paid too much ) are definitely favorites. Whats the one where they build an android of Abraham Lincoln ?
