F Until environmentalists got into the act , politicians often handled water supply problems quite well by constructing large water supply systems well in advance of need. Not in the East Bud ! Nowadays proposals for new water supply systems have large political costs for politicians , because the vengeful environmentalists will attack politicians who think of the future in terms of increasing supply rather than in terms of reducing demand. Denver admits in the future years they will not be able to meet demand. They suggest conservation ! What Denver admits is surely determined by environmentalism. Canada is in a particularly strong position with regard to building new water supply systems as anyone who has flown over it and seen many thousands of lakes can tell you. In the East of Canada ? ? ? Sure you can build dams and ruin fishing and disturp ecosystems. I would suggest reducted demand Previous water projects didnt give priority to not disturbing ecosystems , and fishing was weighed against water supply economically rather than sentimentally.
