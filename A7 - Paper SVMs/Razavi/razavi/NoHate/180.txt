THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SCIENTIFIC DEFINITION OF GOD anywhere in the recorded annals of the scientific history of the World. Therefore , in order to produce a " scientific proof of God " you are also going to have to discover the " scientific definition of God " at the same time. So what we are really talking about is the " scientific discovery of God " not simply the " scientific proof of God " . When Chadwick discovered the Neutron he didnt discover the " scientific proof of the Neutron " he discovered the " definition of the Neutron " at the same time that he discovered the " proof that it exists " . The same is true with God ; as a scientific quantity. I do perceive another of those apples and oranges comparisons. As with many other discoveries , at the time time of the discovery of the neutron , it had no yet been defined. What we in Western society think of as God , however , has been defined and redefined over the last several thousand years. What ever you are describing , I can not tell , but it ceratinly doesnt sound like the God I have read about and heard about. You can call it whatever you will , but unless it fits the classic description , it is not the God everyone has been arguing about proving or disproving for so long. Gary M
