BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE- Hash : SHA1 After all the negative BS about OS/2 , I thought I would do a little purchasing. Bought the brand new EscapeGL version 3.0. After the install program wiped out my desktop and a whole day to recover , I finally have things back to normal. Now , I dont necessarily blame Snow Storm Software and their install program for the crash since this system has been running continuously since OS/2 2.0 ( Warp 4 fp10 at the moment ) . But to the point. EscapeGL is a wonderful screensaver and has all kinds of new modules. Unfortunately , it loves to crash. I have installed oglgold from IBM. EscapeGL does run and all the modules do work. But if I leave it alone in the screensaver mode it traps as follows : The test.exe program doesnt seem to run at all however ? Although I thought it did way back when oglgold was released ? Maybe a fixpack problem ? Maybe my S3 Trio64 drivers ? Maybe only 32 megs of memory ? Maybe I dont have a clue and thought someone out there might have some experience with ogl and EscapeGL ? But , if some kind person does know whats wrong , please let me know. Thanks in advance , Rich. Practice Random Acts of Kindness and Senseless.Umm.Uhh Oh - Heck.I never could remember all that " nice " stuff .
