The Anniversary Waltz By © Richard Budig 1999 The Anniversary Waltz came on today Playing out of the radio into my quiet room And suddenly it all came back to me Scenes from years and years ago The night I called the radio station And requested they play that song Because it was my folks anniversary And sure enough they played it And sure enough I had the radio on loud And I remember how nothing happened No looks passed between them No touch of hands across the table Dad got a funny look on his face And mom just chewed away on something And I sat there wondering if this was love If thiss how it finally works out The Anniversary Waltz playing away In the dead space between two people Who dont seem to see each other anyway If only closed minds came with closed mouths .
