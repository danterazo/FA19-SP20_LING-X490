Why u dont made lin function a member function. templateclass Type class MyClass { private : int N ; Type Data ; public : // constructors and destructor MyClass ( int n ) { N = n ; if ( N 0 ) Data = new Type [ N ] ; } MyClass ( ) { if ( N 0 ) delete [ ] Data ; } int lin ( ) const { return a ; } / accessor -/ } ; For the compilation error I think this is a problem from the borland compiler itself. If function1 is called first the only use of the template is a const MyClassdouble& ie reference , so the compiler do not made any instantiation of the template and apparently can not see than lin is a friend template function ( Note than if the friend function is not inline this portion of code work under bcb3 ) if function2 is used first the compiler see the decl MyClassdouble a ( 8 ) ; template is instancialized and compiler can see correctly the friend function. A correct compiler probably can compile your program directly , but making lin a member function seems better. philippe
