Can anyone tell me if I should learn C or C + + first ? I have to teach myself and I cant get any college courses. It doesnt really matter. Learn them both. Pick one , then also learn data structures too. Also study algorithms. If you know your data structures & algorithms , the language doesnt matter. Linked lists can be implemented in FORTRAN. Binary trees in assembly. Before you buy .
