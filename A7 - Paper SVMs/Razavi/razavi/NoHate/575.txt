I threw caution to the winds today and simply installed 2.1 into my PMMail directory.all went wellI lost no data , and my registration info was untouched. So I would call this a free upgrade. Exactly what it upgrades I am not sure about.there didnt seem to anything in the readme file to indicate new or improved features [ but then I was just home after working a nightshift , so my consciousness was slightly altered. ] . There is at least one improvement. You no longer get black blobs at the end of every line when you print an email on an HP LJ : ) That was pretty much the last bug in my list - its looking real nice. The new icon is cool too hehehe. Craig
