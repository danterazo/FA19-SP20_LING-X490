Whats really needed is tri-state logic : X .EQ. Y , X .NE. Y , X .UNORDERED. Y Arent there intrinsics for that - such as ISNAN , ISFINITE , and company ? As soon as the standardization process completes for ISO/IEC TR 15580 , you should be able , if your compiler vendor is kind enough to implement it , and if your hardware supports IEEE arithmetic , to do something like : USE IEEE_ARITHMETIC WHERE ( IEEE_IS_FINITE ( X ) ) . or IF ( IEEE_UNORDERED ( X , Y ) ) THEN . Nice idea , but long time before it becomes practical ! Michel
