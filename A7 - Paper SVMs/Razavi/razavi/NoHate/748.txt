Hi Jay , before you disappear on us for awhile , I need some of your great expertise and advice. What is your opinions on the Quested VS2205,2108 , and the new VS3208 monitors [ I know you are and avid Quested supporter ] . Also is it worth it to spend the money for the VS115 Sub ? What do you think about the Prism MLA-2 mastering compressor ? I dont know where you are going that there is no internet access , a monastery maybe ? The Tibetan Himalayas ? Easter Island ? Wherever you go , have fun , and we here at the group look forward to your return. Thanks , The " MIXFACTORY " . 38ldi0t.dialup.mindspring.com , Hey guys , to those of you who are interested.
