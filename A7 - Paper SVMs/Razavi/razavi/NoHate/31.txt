YES ! first off 1 ) drugs are relatively cheaper in canada. trust me , I have seen US ads for drugs and they are expensive down there ! 2 ) with such a strong exchange rate , why not ? 3 ) some drugs are OTC here ( eg. codeine , claritin ) . dont come all at once though ! doson Not if you live in Texas ( near Mexico ) . Brad I saw on tv where old folks were going to canada to buy drugs cheaper. is this in fact worthwhile ? regards .
