Correct Frank , see my other message in comp.os.os2.bugs , Boulder his some snags putting up the files , and specifically ran out of space and corrupted XR_M012.FDK. As I posted in the other message , which I will repeat here , we intend to place a header , and until you see that header , the upload is either in progress , or has no been verified yet. We have to place the files on a staging system , and they then transfer to the usual FTP site. Things can and do happen during that move. From my other message indicating the FPs were released. Subject FPs have been released. Boulder did have a SPACE problem , and it appears that FP 12 ran into it. We ( IBM ) are now going to be placing a header file in the FTP directory. For instance , you will see this in XR_W042 Initial Release of OS/2 Warp 3 FP 42 09/30/99 Diskette Images XR_W042.1DK to XR_W042.JDK In XR_M012 you will see this : Initial Release of OS/2 Warp 4 FP 12 09/30/99 Diskette Images XR_M012.1DK to XR_M012.HDK 09/30/99 1 : 30 PM CST Diskette Image XR_M012.FDK replaced , file was corrupt These headers will be updated as we change any file for any reason. We also know people look for new directories , and grab files. The initial headers will now say uploading in progress or not verified/incomplete , and then replaced with an official release date. Irv The two disks that was 0-byte ( xr_m012.gdk and xr_m012.hdk ) till recently seems to be ok now. Jan , Thanks for the posting. Sounds like an indication that there might be further changes in the files before the FixPak is considered " ready to release " . It might be advisable to wait a day or so to see if an " official " FixPak Release Notice gets posted before downloading the files. Could be a pain to find ones system nonfunctional and have to perform emergency repairs , only to learn that the FixPak had been updated ten minutes after ones download. Not to mention the time for downloading twice for those with sub-T1 connections ( ; . Frank McKenney , McKenney Associates Richmond , Virginia / ( 804 ) 320-4887
