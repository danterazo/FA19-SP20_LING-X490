On Fri , 15 Oct 1999 + 0200 , " Dani Sidler " David , Do you know of any FAQ that would allow a Linux newbie like me to setup sendmail for mail relaying from a DMZ as you described ? Right now I am thinking of installing a SonicWall/DMZ and need to make a decision on whether I should let SMTP trough the FW to my Exchange server ( dont like the thought ) or using relay , but dont want to put a NT box into my DMZ just for relaying when a linux box does the same better and cheaper. I have some experience with setting up Linux as a DNS and web server in a lab environment , but sendmail makes me shiver . Thanks , I did this using exim ( another Linux MTA ) using a domain list router ( I believe thats what it is called ) . it is one single config file for all of exim and I simply have a list of the domains to be relayed inward to the Exchange server. I am at home right now , so I cant see the exact configuration I did , but you might want to take a look at exim , the one-config-file-does-it-all approach is really nice for simple setups like that.
