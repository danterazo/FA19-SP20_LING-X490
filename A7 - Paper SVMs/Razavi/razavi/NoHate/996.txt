A further point is that not only would a drum recorder prevent signals being missed when the instrument isnt being watched , it would also provide permanent records that could be passed around to interested parties. Roger Musson Some time ago Dennis posted that it was _not possible_ ( due to their inherent nature ) to record the signals. From the context , it was quite clear that it was not due to any lack of equipment or funds , but that it was some feature of the signals themselves that prevented recording. Nobody really seemed to pick up on that , but it seemed like an extremely odd assertion to me. And so far nobody has asked ( so far as I know ) for a very general description of the nature of the emanations. Seems to me that he would not give the game away too much by just indicating whether they are electromagnetic , seismic , barometric , sonic , psychic , tidal , astronomical , or what. Dennis has taken interest in his theory to be evidence of support for his prediction aspirations. I shall quite honestly admit what I think others know of themselves. I am searching for a handhold with which to further skewer this pretender ( sincere , but deluded ) . But he is extremely slippery. Dennis - are your signals produced by some force or energy heretofore undiscovered by science ? Are they one ( or more ) of those listed above ? Without this information , it will be very hard for scientists to provide any support whatsoever ( considering the current lack of statistical , methodological or other evidence regarding your speculations ) . Since I made it a point over a year ago to filter posts from this " Mouth from the South " of California , I will rely on attributions to satisfy what little curiosity I have.
