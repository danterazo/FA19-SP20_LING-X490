Daniel , I can not begin to recommend Scott Meyers " Effective C + + " and " More Effective C + + " highly enough , although get the CD it is a much better value than buying the hardcopy versions. Marshall Cline has published a printed and more complete version of the C + + FAQ , and I find much of it useful , and much of it awfully obvious ( thats not a criticismconsider the audience for FAQs ) . A good C book , if you can find it , is " C Traps and Pitfalls " . Although it is C specific and doesnt get into OOP etc , there is a lot of good material in there that is applicable to both languages. Lin [ please reply to newsgroup only.thnaks ] As of late it seems like every question I have been asking has been classified as a " classic C + + problem " or " an example of pure evil in C + + " . I would like to know if there are any recommended texts that deal specifically with the " classic problems " ? I would much rather read through such a book and make myself readily aware of the C + + " toughies " and perhaps even be able to help others out rather than just post question after question and leech knowledge from the group.
