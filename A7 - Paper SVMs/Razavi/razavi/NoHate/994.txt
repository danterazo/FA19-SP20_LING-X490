A near vertical strikeslip fault would produce a spherical projection with an " x " ? I assume that the P-wave polarity analysis produces two possible planes and the more vertically oriented the polarity of the waves reaching a seismic station the more " x-like " the projection. At least that is what I got from reading the explanation at the trinet site. I am not certain your projection represents the same thing , it doesnt look like an " x " anyway. A regional moment tensor solution is appended belowthe mechanism indicates nearly-vertical strike-slip motion , entirely in keeping with expectations for an event of this magnitude in the Mojave Shear Zone. If you are not familiar with these " beach balls , " the idea is that the two arcs cutting across the ball indicate two possible rupture planes. ( From standard seismic analysis of this type , there is always an ambiguity between two planes ) . A surface rupture has been identified by geologists who were able to fly over the region yesterday. Its orientation is consistent with the plane that strikes just west of N ; an orientation that is also similar to faulting in both the 1992 Joshua Tree and Landers earthquakes.
