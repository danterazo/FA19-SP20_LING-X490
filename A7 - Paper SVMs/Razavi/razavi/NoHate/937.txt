As some of you may know , Electronics Now and Popular Electronics magazines are combining into one magazine , Poptronics , to reduce operating costs. Thats assuming they survive the Chapter 11 bankruptcy that they went into this week. They hope to pull out of it by reducing costs. Both magazines have been suffering rapidly falling circulation for the past couple of years , even though ( as far as I can tell ) the quality of the magazines has actually improved somewhat during that time. As someone who often writes magazine articles , I am curious : What kind of electronics magazine would you like to see on the newsstands ? ( Or on the web ? Or combined ? ) If youd like it to be on the web , how would you run it ? What do you think are the weak points of the existing magazines ? I am referring to newsstand magazines , not industrial controlled-circulation ones ( EDN , Elec. Design , etc. ) ; those are going strong but are unavailable to individual experimenters outside the electronics industry. Discussion welcome ! Dont pull any punches.
