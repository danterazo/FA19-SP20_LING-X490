A question just occurred to me How come all of these Hollow Earth advocates never go to this big huge hole in the ground themselves ? You know , snap a few shots , take a few samples , and then come back and stun the scientific world ? Is there a reason that they make their claims solely on the basis of satellite photos with missing data and third ( or more ) hand reports of long dead explorers ( which were probably fabricated in the first place ) ? it is very dangerous. You might fall in and never get out , and many scientists believe that the underground caverns are full of dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs. It is the same reason that astronauts are never sent to photograph black holes. Gerry Quinn
