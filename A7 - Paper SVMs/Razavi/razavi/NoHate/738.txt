Hi , In October , I will be relocating my midsized recording studio into the London area. I am looking for either a partner to split the costs/equipment/duties/fun/profits with or an engineer who would become my partner. I am primarily a songwriter. The equipment that I currently own is state-of-the-art , all discrete outboard running into a ProTools MIX 24 on a Mac 9600 with 38 GB of disk space. Other brands include Manley , Avalon , Neve , Summit , Empirical Labs , Neumann , BPM tube mic , AKG tube mic , Audiotechnica , Beyerdymamic , Kurzweil , Korg , Aragon , Tascam , Sennheiser , Westlake monitoring , Axon , KAT , Gibson , Hamer , Fender , Marshall , Acoustic , Ampeg. I have recently acquired a discrete , 24 in , 24 out mixing console that sounds better than David Bowie and will be purchasing a 24 track , 2 inch tape recorder. Thanks , Scott PS - I am also looking for an existing , deserted recording studio space to purchase or rent .
