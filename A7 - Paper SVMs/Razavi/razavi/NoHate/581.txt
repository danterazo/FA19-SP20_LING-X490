I think part of the problem is that doing a sync remix for Revolver-Mystery Tour is VERY difficult. It should be fairly easy for the 8-track since theorectically they can just remix the 8 tracks straight with no jiggery pokery. Yes , with the 4-tracks ( espercially 66-67 ) the parts come from two , three , or four source tapes. With the 8 tracks , it is all first generation except for a few when they started with a 4-track and copied that to 8-track. Jud McCranie
