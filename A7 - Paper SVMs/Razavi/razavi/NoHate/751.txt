Hi I am writing some documents on OS/2 development ( multithreading , WPS an = d PM ) in Lotus WordPro. However , it seems that many users dont use WordPro , = so I want to make PDF : s from my documents. Is there any way to do this automatically ? I dont mind going via some other format ( ie. Post scr = ipt ) if needed. I dont want to use HTML since it isnt printer friendly. /j What you must do is to 1. Install a postscript printer driver ( does not matter much which ) 2. Install Ghostview and Ghostscript. Then , make a postscriptfile , by telling the driver that it shall save to disk. Then import the postscriptfile into Ghostview , tell it to print , chose pdrwrite 300 dpi , and you have you pdf-file. It is quite simple , both the installation and the process. Howerver : The pdf-file you get is only 300. You can get more if you edit printer.ini , but if you do , it seems that noone who does not have your typpefaces can read it propertly. Me , I got destiller from adobe , and create a pdf-file from the postscript- file I got in OS/2 ( Describe ) . Destiller makes much nicer pdf-filer. The have 2400 dpi resolution , and are small. By book is 250 pages , and the pdf-file is 800k ! / Jan = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = 3D = = 3D = 3D = 3D Jan Hartman Filosofiska institutionen/Department of Philosophy Lunds Universitet/Lund University = Kungshuset , Lundag = E5rd + 46- ( 0 ) 46 22232 = 53 S-222 22 Lund fax + 46- ( 0 ) 46 = 2224424 Sweden
