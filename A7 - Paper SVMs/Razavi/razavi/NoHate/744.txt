Hi , I am trying to use my Umax Astra 1220S scanner with the CFM tgwain drivers. The program will not recognize my scanner. It work fine with my other OSs just not with os2. Could anyone help who is using this scanner. Open the file scanner.ini ( in my system it is in the directory : boot drive : \ os2 \ twain \ cfm512 , but your lowest-level directory may be different ) . Go to the section labelled UMAX , and insert another paragraph as follows : [ Astra 1220S ] Driver = UMAX ParameterFile = 1220S Thats all it needs. Stan Goodman Qiryat Tivon Israel me. Sorry. Send E-mail to : domain : hashkedim dot com , username : stan. 
