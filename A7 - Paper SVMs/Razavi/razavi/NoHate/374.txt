On Sun , 17 Oct 1999 -0400 , " Michael A. Covington " Both magazines have been suffering rapidly falling circulation for the past couple of years , even though ( as far as I can tell ) the quality of the magazines has actually improved somewhat during that time. You can make the best quality buggy whip in the world , but if nobody buys them any more , youll go out of business. I think that popular electronics magazines had their day in the sun , but that day is over. Maybe they could bring back the " Carl and Jerry " stories. Jim
