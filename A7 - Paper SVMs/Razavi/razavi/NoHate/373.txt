On Sun , 17 Oct 1999 , " Graham C. Norris " Symptoms , symptoms , symptoms ! What happens ? What does it say ? Does it trap ? Does it hang ? Give people SOMETHING to go on if you want help. Graham. THis startup command w/ the included rexx command did work before. Now running this startup.cmd w/ the included rexx command I get : If this is the start of the STARTUP.CMD file try putting a / / at the beginning of the file and place " " ( thats a single quote ) around the first eight ( 8 ) lines. IE : C : cd \ MMOS2 \ AP OR - split this into two files ( one STARTUP.CMD and the other STARTREX.CMD and call the STARTREX file from STARTUP. The REXX file would have all the stuff after the initial / Select Shutdown Sound Effect / line. I can capture these results : At this point the CMD command line processor is trying to execute your REXX commands and can not do it as the REXX processor is only loaded if the FIRST line in the file is a / / comment line SYS1041 : The name Sysini is not recognized as an internal or external command , operable program or batch file .
