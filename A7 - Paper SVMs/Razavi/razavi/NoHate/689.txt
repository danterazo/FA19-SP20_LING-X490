I am not sure how to check a variable that was assigned a value from cin for an integer. I see two ways , one is using isdigit ( varname ) but i cant seem to get my borland c + + compiler to work. The other way is using a case statement ( switch ) where i give it all the possible choice , but there must be a better way no ? ? Before you buy. I do it like this : assuming your text is in text , a character array The scanf-style functions return the number of items successfully parsed and assigned. If you ask for an integer and any other character , it should return 1 if the entire string is an integer , as there should be no supplementary characters. If it returns 0 or 2 , the string was not an integer. Kind regards , Bern Before you buy .
