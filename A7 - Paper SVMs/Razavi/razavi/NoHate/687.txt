I am not to sure about this left lateral displacement I suggested in a previous thread , in fact I have found contradicting evidence to suggest right lateral displacement- if it is even possible to determine this using AS points ( probably , but not easy ) . I am however , at this point , convinced that the Hector fault is a low angle normal fault striking NW and dipping West , perhaps a very low angle. A regional moment tensor solution is appended belowthe mechanism indicates nearly-vertical strike-slip motion , entirely in keeping with expectations for an event of this magnitude in the Mojave Shear Zone. If you are not familiar with these " beach balls , " the idea is that the two arcs cutting across the ball indicate two possible rupture planes. ( From standard seismic analysis of this type , there is always an ambiguity between two planes ) . A surface rupture has been identified by geologists who were able to fly over the region yesterday. Its orientation is consistent with the plane that strikes just west of N ; an orientation that is also similar to faulting in both the 1992 Joshua Tree and Landers earthquakes.
