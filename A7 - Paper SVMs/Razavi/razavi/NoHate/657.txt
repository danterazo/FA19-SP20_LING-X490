I can hear clicks and pops in some games and programs under Windows98SE. Is it mainboards or SoundBlasters problem ? How can I fix that ? i have the same thing going on. i believe it is a sounblaster issue being that i have a different motherboard thats basically brand new. i have an a-bit be6 , 96M ram , and a p3-500 and when I am playing mp3s from a different partion of my drive programs running on C : still seem to make the music skip every so often when they are not skipping i can hear crackles and other imperfections that really bother me because I am naturally listening for them now any help would be appreciated. i suspect a design flaw in the 128 Posted via CNET Help.com
