What does Apple get out of this ? Another ( much , much better ) O/S for their H/W if they so chose. Apple gets absolutely nothing positive out of this , should it take off. Apple doesnt need another OS for their hardware ( especially a third party OS , unless they buy out QSSL ) . They have two of their own , after all. Apple wants control , remember ? I dont think that Apple will choose to release hardware specs , but if they did ( and port their software to NTO ) , I definately believe it would revitalize their company. Amigans would have a substantial H/W vendor for their platform ; and hey , all the MAC apps that Apple ported would run on Amiga , and all the Amiga apps would run on Apple , and the M $ hegemony would have a two front battle on their hands ( Linux - back office , and Amiga/Apple - desktop ) . It would be cool , but probably will not happen since everyone is too busy fighting with each other to put together a substantial attack against the real monster.
