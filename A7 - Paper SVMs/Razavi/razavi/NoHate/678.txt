I am trying to find the manufactories of linear IC optocouplers. I am sure there are others , but I only know about : InfineonSiemens semiconductors , another silly re-badging snip preliminary warm-up rant Took a look at HPs site and found which looks VERY similar to the Infineon part , BUT : rant EVEN BLOODY HP HAVE CHANGED THE NAME OF THEIR COMPONENTS DIVISION TO SOMETHING MEANINGLESS ! so now British SteelCorus , HPAgilent , SiemensInfineon , AMDVantis , AT&TLucent. WTF is going on ? Is it no longer acceptable to the market analysts to name your company after its founders , or after what it does ? Are we so scared of words that MEAN something , that we have to change every company name to meaningless drivel ? Can I rename our universitys EE department " Novedel " ? /rant ok , it is nearly the weekend , time to hit the gin and then it will all seem SOOOO much better. Jonathan Bromley
