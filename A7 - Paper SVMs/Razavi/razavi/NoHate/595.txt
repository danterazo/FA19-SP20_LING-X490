I purchased the same battery from Radio Shack about two weeks ago , and have logged about five hours with it without any noticable decay in performance. ( I use the ac adaptor from my driveway I use the battery " in the field " away from home ) . The charger seems overpriced. I intend to charge the battery using an automobile battery charger with a series resistor in order to limit the current to under 1 Amp. If this doesnt work , I will bite the bullet and purchase the charger. Chuck I have been considering that same Radio Shack battery as well. it is nice and compact and is sealed. I too , am not sure about the charger. The battery label specifically states not to use and automobile charger ( not sure why ) and the one suggested is very expensive , about $ 50. I will bet you anything you can use you Celestron AC adaptor to charge the battery ( no series resistor required ) . I have charged up my car and motorcycle batteries with similar 12 adaptors with no problem. It just takes a long time , maybe overnight. Before you buy .
