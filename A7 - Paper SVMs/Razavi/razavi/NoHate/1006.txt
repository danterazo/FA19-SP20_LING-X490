[ Subject of desktops on small systems ] Photon has a window manager and a desktop manager , and I was most certainly including them , when I made the above statement. How does the environment compare to the one presented by KDE in terms of whats provided ? I cant really tell that much about the environment from QNXs screen shots. there is enough in standard QNX to use Photon for all normal activities. You get a shell ( command line ) Help viewer File manager Network Note mechanism CD player Diary / Day scheduler A simple calculator A simple graphic viewer Screen dump utility Jump gate ( for moving running applications from one node to another ) sytems tools ( sin , sac , font , print ) and some demos and games. .and the whole focus of the QNX/Amiga thing is to beef-up the " desktopedness " of the environment ; as well as provide the apps ( by getting the developers to port ) that are the Amiga mainstays. What does QSSL get out of this ? They get a foothold as a desktop O/S ; an important step if they want to remain a viable self-hosted O/S ( and not be relegated to the faceless heap of cross-developed RTOSs ) . What do Amigans get out of it ? They get a state-of-the-art RTOS and network distributed GUI on which to build their apps ; they also get the benefit of multiple CPU targets ( PPC and x86 for sure , maybe MIPS ) . The key target is PPC which is unavailable to M $ Windoze users. What does Motorola get out of this ? Another desktop/home PC application for their high-end parts besides Apple. What does Apple get out of this ? Another ( much , much better ) O/S for their H/W if they so chose.
