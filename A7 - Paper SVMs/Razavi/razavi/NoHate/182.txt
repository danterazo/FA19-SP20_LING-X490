There is no rule saying that you cant stack barlows. Some combinations of stacked barlows , however , can cause vignetting of the image. Nagler eyepieces have barlows built in and I havent have any problems barlowing them. Dave Hello people , I have a 4.5 " reflector. Just thought I would pass along some information. The short-tubes have built in barlows , so using an external barlow isnt recommended. However , this weekend , I used a 32mm eyepiece , and a 3x televue barlow on my short-tube just to see what would happen. Except for balancing problems due to the extra weight , I got the best image of Saturn and Jupiter that I have ever had. It was the largest clear image ever. I have also tried a 10mm kellner , and a 9mm plossl , but neither view compares. It could be that you need a little more than 10mm , because 1/3 f 32mm is 10.66mm when you use a 3x barlow , but thats not my point. The point is , that you can " stack " barlows. I think this is possible because the internal barlow in the short tubes are relatively weak. Just thought youd like to know.
