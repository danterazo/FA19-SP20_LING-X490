Tell us your precise understanding of terminator technology. Seeds of later Generations become sterile = You cant make them grown anything ! Why ? If there was an international disaster = an asteroid his the one and only seed producers there is = Monsanto. And the whole world is disrupted = Than Human survival depends on Sterile seeds ? ? ? ? A mad mans dream = James Watts dream. James Watt was a Fundamentalist who believed that if say an oil spilll disrupted Calif waters , than we would be just that closer to the final coming. I put these nut cases in James Watts camp ! You have skipped a lot of steps. There are enormous efforts in several countries ever since the 1930s to preserve plant germ plasm. Do you imagine these seed banks being abandoned ? Even for the crops for which Monsanto and other companies make sterile seeds , is a complete monopoly likely ?
