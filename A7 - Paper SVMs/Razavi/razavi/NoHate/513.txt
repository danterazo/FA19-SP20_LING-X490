In the Eastern US , town name signs usually have the date they were founded or settled. In the Midwest , it is population , and in the West , it is elevation above sea level. As a broad and no doubt exception-ridden generality. All the town signs I have seen ( mostly here in California ) have population as well as elevation. How widespread are the large town signs one often sees here , maybe six or eight feet square , with the logos of the Rotary and the Kiwanis and all the other groups of that ilk , indicating where and when they meet ? And are they a sign of small-town-hood ? Albany has one ; I dont think Berkeley does. ( If it did , the signs would probably be for groups other than the Rotary and the Kiwanis. ) Dorothy J.
