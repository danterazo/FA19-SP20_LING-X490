Does anyone run IBM OS2 Warp and an Amiga System ? I did at one time. IBM stopped developing OS/2. Once I realized that fact , I abandoned OS/2 , and moved on to Linux. There is an effort to convince IBM to open-source OS/2. I still have my Amigas though. I just thru together a 486slc2 33/16 installed OS2 Warpand now I really multitask. About 160 $ - really needed a Promise IDE controller and 80x CD 32 bit buffered. If I only had 4 arms at least. This thing flys like faster than a 400 Mhz Win95 ! About the same as 040/50 only more stable. OS2 is very good OS , actually 3 OSs in one Win3.1 System ( core ) Dos 5.0 and OS2 itself. Now I have my Amiga2000hd for graphics only And the OS2 for Multimedia and TCP/IP and DOS. Zangband is soo cool on DOSI can play CD and hear the sound from Zangband with no noise. Mr. Biddlesworth
