I have been out of the OS/2 stream for a few years now - I blame it on work , but thats another thread. My question is about the great browser history feature that I once used in an old OS/2 web browser , the name of which I forget. It was the popular browser back in the Warp days , and you could get a detailed " map " of everywhere youd navigated during a particular session. Does anyone know of an IE or Netscape ( Windows version ) addon that provides this functionality ? I cant believe the Windows world doesnt have this. Or should I be surprised ? Thanks for any info , Craig P.S. Sorry for saying the W word in this group ; )
