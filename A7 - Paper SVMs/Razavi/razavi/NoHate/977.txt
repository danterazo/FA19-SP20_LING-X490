All , 15 minutes ago , about 02 : 50 A.M. , 10/16/99 , I was awakened by mattress movement and clothes hanger sounds. I believe I may have felt my first EQ. My location is in Northwest Phoenix , AZ. I was working on my computer here in San Diego , and it was easily the strongest quake I have EVERY felt , and I am a native , and 51 years old. Latest from CalTech , moved north from initial location , to Hector Crater , about 33 miles east and slightly south of Barstow along Hwy 40. To reply by email , remove the XYZ. Please dont spam this account , it is a violation of California Law !
