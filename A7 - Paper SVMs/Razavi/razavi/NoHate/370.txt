On Thu , 14 Oct 1999 -0700 , Michael Thomas The following lines : SET BLASTER = A240 I7 D3 T4 LH C : \ WINDOWS \ ASP4DOS.COM are automatically written to autoexec.bat , even if I delete them. How do I prevent these lines from being written ? I have the same Problem - if you have I solution , please inform me ! Mark I remd em out. Should look like this : rem SET BLASTER = A240 I7 D3 T4 rem LH C : \ WINDOWS \ ASP4DOS.COM it is the same with rem in front - autoexec.bat is rewritten without the rem. Any other ideas ? I know there was a way , but how to manage it. ? Mark
