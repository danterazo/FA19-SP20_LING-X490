Thirdly , if it is a mechanical rotary encoder , the edges wont be clean enough to use interrupts directly , no matter what you do. The way we solved the mechanical problem is to put the program into a loop that reads portb rerpeatedly until it settles down. The following is if the A and B are the pins of interest : Isnt the normal practice to debounce the encoder as one would debounce a pushbutton switch ? Adding a 5-10 ms delay after the interrupt is first detected then checking the port again should debounce just about any mechanical input there is. He said 12.5kHz , so a 5ms debounce isnt going to work ; in any event multiple edges may not be due to bounce but due to jitter of the armature. At 12.5kHz it is bound to be an optical device. IMO the best way is to forget using the encoder inputs as interrupts. Set a timer interrupt going faster than the maximum pulse rate and scan the two inputs. If they have changed since last time , either count up or down depending on the change. Use a state machine to only allow counts on valid changes and ( if it is important ) alert the user in the event of an invalid change. This is much more satisfactory , and easy to do. Using external interrupts in this way is not very good practice ; you have no guarantee that jitter may not happen faster than your controller can respond to. Dont know what the 50mV bit means - are these open collector outputs ? Cheers Keith Wootten
