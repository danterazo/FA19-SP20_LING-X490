Not ? I dont really use g77 but I thought ( I read in the SuSE docs ) it would merely run the f2c and hand the result over to the local cc. If this is not the case ( or it was and has been changed ) then sackcloth and ashes shall be my garment. A typical Linux distribution includes f77 , which is a script that runs f2c , and g77 , which is a real Fortran 77 front-end integrated with the gcc compiler system. Bring on the sackcloth and ashes ! g
