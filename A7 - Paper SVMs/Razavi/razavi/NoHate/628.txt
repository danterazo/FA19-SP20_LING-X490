I have a grandfather clock. Since you all seem to be wondering around , I will ask this question thats been on my Lifes Mysteries list. Will my grandfathers clock keep the same time on the moon ? For small amplitudes , the period of its pendulum is given : T = 2Pisqrt ( L/g ) Where L = the pedulums length g = acceleration due to gravity From this you can draw your own conclusion , simply by asking yourself the question is the moons gravity the same thing as that of the Earth , all other things being the same.
