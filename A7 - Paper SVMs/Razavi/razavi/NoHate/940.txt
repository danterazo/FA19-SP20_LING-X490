As of late it seems like every question I have been asking has been classified as a " classic C + + problem " or " an example of pure evil in C + + " . I would like to know if there are any recommended texts that deal specifically with the " classic problems " ? I would much rather read through such a book and make myself readily aware of the C + + " toughies " and perhaps even be able to help others out rather than just post question after question and leech knowledge from the group. Sure. " Objects Unencapsulated " is full of them. Follow the link in my signature. Ian Joyner Objects Unencapsulated
