Luc , while I know your new to these groups you should be careful about making wide claims. You said : Sorry. But finding original results in the archive of this newsgroup proved to be too time consuming if one does not know what to search for. Therefore . The best means of such searching is using DejaNews.Com and its power search facility. But you are right , I should have provided the key words ( the Title of the post ) " The Nature of Charge " post 5/7/99 , here is the exact address : hitnum = 20 Therefore the only way for the authors of these theories to convince the physics community would be to do some calculations which were never done before. Patently untrue. I will give you two . . could you tell me where I can find a detailled presentation of the results you cited ? IMHO this is the first thing you should have done. Yes , see above. Now it is my turn to apologize , sorry. Paul Stowe
