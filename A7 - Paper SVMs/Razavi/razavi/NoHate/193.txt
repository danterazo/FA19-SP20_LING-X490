The RM Vision Wah is NEW- and we will have info with photos in the near future- sorry , but my adv budget is miniscule compared to big money mfrs. I will have a new www site and you will be able to see the first images of the Vision Wah there first. We are just waiting for Internic to switch internet hosts to our new server- again- sorry for the delay. All relays use magnetics to activate- that is their nature. Large coils in large relays pull lotsa current. Small coils in small relays pull small current. The relays used here are small. Roger Mayers electronics are always highly efficient- no worrys , mate.
