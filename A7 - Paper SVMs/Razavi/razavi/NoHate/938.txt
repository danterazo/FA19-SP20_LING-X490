As one teacher who aked everyone their ethnicity/heritage commented , " You come from an ancient heritage " . End of story - I had no need to flaunt it. You are 100 % right ! Of course the opinion of an American school teacher ( we all know how qualified they are ) has much more gravity than the views of the overwhelming majority of professors/academics who claim Macedonia to be part of the Greek world ( they are all lying Hope ) . Its only later when certain forces reared their ugly heads did all of this become vital. ? ? ? Costas LONG LIVE THE SCHOOL TEACHER !
