The rexx script in my startup.cmd doesnt function. It appears I have lost REXX support w/ out trying to remove it. I dont see it in selective install. How do I restore REXX ? Have you tried to run a REXX script to verify REXX is not there ? Normally STARTUP.CMD is not a REXX script ; it is more along the lines of the old DOS command shell. Indeed , if the first line does not have " / whatever / " in it , it is not a REXX script at all. sma at rtd dot com Remove " .spam-not " for email
