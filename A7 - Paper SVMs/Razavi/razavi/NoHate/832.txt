Every thing in the our universe has mass , right ? So , if my dreams exsist dont they have some weight ? Actual answer : Probably. Depends on what a " dream " consists of in the brain. If it involves the creation of molecules which remain , then your dream has gained weight. If it involves the destruction of molecules to leave behind traces of their change , then your dream has lost weight. If it involves merely the rearrangement of atoms on molecules , then your dream can still be said to have gained weight by the assignment of those molecules to your dream ( this also reverses the net effect of the molecular disintegration paradigm mentioned just previously ) . However , there is at least one cat around here ( Hi , Jack ! ) who will tell you ( but you wont understand ) that thought is primarily a quantum process , so youd have to get into the assignment of photonic energy , which according to Einstein still represents mass , if not " weight " . Since youve posted , your dream has gained the weight of the magnetic domains it occupies on all the news-server hard drives on which it now exists , a very few of which are allocated to retain it permanently , or transfer it to optical disks , or to the next great storage medium , when it arrives. But do they carry any philosophical weight ? Dream on. Blair " DVD-R drives still cost about 3 grand. "
