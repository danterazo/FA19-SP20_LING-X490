. followups reduced significantly . I missed one important point , do somebody checks theses problems ? and do the writer take the time to see weather the problem at the end of a chapter really asks about previous knowledge or do you have to have some understanding about the advance chapters too ? I am not referring to H&R but generally all graduate and undergraduate level textbooks. The answers in intro texts are usually produced by graduate students of the author and get checked along the way by the users of the book. New editions can be a problem , but they do ( usually ) get fixed over time. Graduate textbooks do not have answers in the back , and some of the so-called solutions books are famous for having errors in them , since they are just someones ( again , often students ) set of solutions. The _problems_ in any physics textbook assume you know the material that came before the current chapter. The preface to the book usually states what chapters can be skipped without causing difficulties. Sometimes chapters/topics are not in a sequence and you are to jump right in middle of the book. Perhaps for review , but not for content or problem solving. You can not do a central force problem where the force is from Coulomb if you have not studied central force problems. Commercial e-mail is _NOT_ that resolves to my account for any reason at any time .
