Who survived longer , the dinosaurs or humans ( In other words , whos here now ? ) ? ? ? Humans did , my theory of the " Survival of the Most Intelligent " , is more correct than Darwins , Survival of the Fittest . Those are no " in other words " but quite different words. Who is here now does not equate to who survived longer. As I pointed out in my previous post , the length of time humans have existed is as a drop in a bucket to the length of time dinosaurs walked the Earth. adn whether or not we will survive for even a small fraction of the time they did is still in question and not likely to be answered in our lifetimes.
