Look for an IRQ conflict in the device manager. Windows 98 wont report a conflict , but look for a device that is using the same IRQ as the soundcard. If you find one then you need to move it to another IRQ. Victor My friend is having a multimedia problem with Windows 98. When playing some longer sounds ( ie wave files ) , the sounds are : ( a ) cut off before the end ( Sound Recorder ) , or ( b ) the program plays a split second of the sound and stops. ( If he clicks again , it does the same thing but with the next part of the sound. ) This happens with the software that came with the sound driver. When playing videos files ( ie the CART demo video on the Win 98 CD ) , the sound is choppy. Video plays fine , but the sound alternates between being there and not being there over 2 to 3 second periods. The sound system on his computer is a Creative ViBRA 16 which is built into the motherboard. He is running Windows 98 on an Intel Celeron 333 MHz chip. The computer has 32 MB of RAM. We have tried reintalling updated drivers and even reinstalling Windows 98. Nothing seems to work. MIDI works fine , and playing CDs is okay , it is just the sound files. Anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this or how to fix it ? Do you have any radio job leads ?
