Please note that caffeine is not a diuretic in the true sense - it does not act in the kidney. Which herbal diuretics actually work ? Dandelion root. Of course , I take triple the recommended dosage , but it is pretty effective ( plus contains potassium ) . Good old caffeine aint so bad either ! Before you buy .
