( snip ) Nowadays with all these holistic hucksters shilling for the wonders of " natures antibiotic " , I wonder if this will become a problem again. Since turning color seems to depend on a vairety of items - amount taken daily , strength , and ? and in combinatin with ? , it might be a while before people turn colors. All I can say is : I would love to be rid of the 2 infections I have and be more or less , sort of , feeling better than I am currently. But I am not going to try this stuff until I check with the docs. And then there is the banning of OTC CS. It should be interesting to see what happens. I need to improve my search skills : ) thanks again. MA
