And " Hello Kitty Pads " too. I was in a convenience store with a CHYK and I saw a plastic package with a picture of Hello Kitty on it. So I said " Kitty ! " and reached to pick it up. She slapped my hand down and shouted " NO ! " . Later I went back to the store without her and looked at the packet to determine that they were those little mouse pillow pads that women like to use. Who was " she " who slapped your hand ? And whats a mouse pillow pad that we women like to use ? I obviously MUST get one since we women like them so !
