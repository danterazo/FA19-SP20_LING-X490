Now , will the clock mechanism still work ? In other words , does any of the gear movement depend on an atmospheric pressure ? Probably not , though vacuum causes lubricating oils to dry a lot faster. I suppose I wont be able to hear the bongs or the music when the quarter hours are struck. Right ? Not if you are in a spacesuit with the clock on the surface , unless you get some vibration through the feet. I guess I will have some problems with the moon phase on the clock face. /BAH Just assume it is an Earth phase. As seen on the moon , Earth phase mirrors moon phase anyway. When we see the moon at 3/4 phase , on the moon the Earth appears at 1/4 phase .
