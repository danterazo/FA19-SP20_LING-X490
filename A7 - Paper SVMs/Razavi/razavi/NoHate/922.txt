Bitter ? More like incredulous. I hear that FMAIM is asking people to send money. Lots of it. Despite off-the-cuff assurances that oh yes , they have all kinds of money. HUH ? What money ? Team AMIGA Central is NON-Profit and always will be. Actually I fund it myself. I do not ask for nor accept any donations in capital of any kind , no cash , no checks , no credit cards , no gifts. I didnt mention Team Amiga. But youve thrown in pretty big with FMAIM , Uh , no , actually I havent " thrown in " with anyone. I tend to make my own decisions. I have reservations about QNX , have voiced them and gotten good answers from Dan Dodge. and I know that they are asking for money , and I have been informed that they are in fact asking over the Team Amiga mailing list , now that you bring it up. We do not stifle what happens over the TAML. Anyone there is free to voice any opinions , pro or con. A decision I stand by as some good ideas start that way. No , I know you dont take money for Team Amiga , because you are not using Team Amiga to try to take over the world. Hehehe , too big and no interest . I have enough to do.
