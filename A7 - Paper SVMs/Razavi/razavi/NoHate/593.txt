I read recently somewhere that the business abotu standing in a doorway is obsolete avice. Modern wood-frame buildings are not especially stronger in doors than eslewhere , and in a doorway the door could whap you a lot. If the building collapses you are in trouble anyway. Get under a desk. I dont HAVE a desk ! What should I DO ? An earthquake could strike at ANY MOMENT and I have nowhere to shelter ! HELP ! Simon Clark - Urban Crime-Fighter Before you buy .
