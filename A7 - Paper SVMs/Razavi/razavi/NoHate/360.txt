Only Warp 4 has the ability to recreate these diskettes using " original GA " files or building a " most current " set of boot diskettes. If that does not help , look at the source directory for the utility disk files. What ? I dont understand this sentence. By " source directory " are you alluding to the INPUT files to the copy process ? If so , that is really my question. because I dont know what this directory would be if it is not \ OS2 \ BOOT , etc. Just use the directory that sysinstx resides in for the source. \ os2 \ install \ bootdisk in Warp 3 .
