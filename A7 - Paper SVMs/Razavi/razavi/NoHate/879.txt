Dennis : Positivism restricts itself to " what is seen in nature " and mathematics is simply a symbolic tool for describing what is seen in nature. It are the materialists and objective realists who try to go beyond just descriptions of what is seen in natureand hypothesize underlying material causes. All we can know directly is what we perceive with the senses we have. Any other knowledge is indirect , resting on hypothesis and inference. Since we do not have the senses to see all the way to the bottom of reality the BEST we can do is posit hypothesis and hope they predict what we do see. Even if an hypothesis predicts correctly , that is not a basis for saying it is true. In order to do that you have to eliminate every other hypothesis that yield the same prediction. You are asking more of your senses and your limited mental capacity ( not just yours , but all of us ) than they can produce , if you think we can find the TRUTH with any certainty. The history of science is littered with bust theories , each of which was believed to be TRUE at one time. The best we can come up with is a progression of models that predict what we will perceive under various circumstances. Bob Kolker
