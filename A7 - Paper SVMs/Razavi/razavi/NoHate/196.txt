The Pentax and Canon suggestions are good. Make certain that whatever model you choose uses batteries that are currently marketed and easily available at reasonable prices. Something with a decent market for used lenses is a plus also for possible future considerations. Pentax , Minolta , Canon , Nikon ( in no order , I use the last ) . I would recommend a nice 50mm f1.7-2.0 range prime lens over a slow zoom. And it can be a good idea to post with questions about models after you narrow your search to learn about bugs or service problems that the seller _might_ forget to mention to you. Spoo
