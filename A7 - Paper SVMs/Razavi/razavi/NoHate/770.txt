Here I am back again for your opinions. Have been trying to get med for hypertension that would have least side effects. After many years.Cardizem seemed to be causing depression Tried Accupril .caused bone pain Tried Coozar.still bone pain Now trying Hyrin.at level 2 .taking at night. acts like a sleeping pill with that next day pilll sluggishnes but no other side effect. Asked doc to try level l.because seems like least side effects of any tried so far.Think maybe lower strength would be less of pill hangover feeling. QuestionAll above drugs seem to control pressurebut Hytrin seems to have least problem. Is Hytrin used very often for hypertension ? Any input.comments welcome.Thank you again for inputAnnie
