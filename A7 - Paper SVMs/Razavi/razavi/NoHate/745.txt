Hi , Does anyone know the difference between a DC/DC converter and a voltage regulator ? Andre. The labels say it all. A DC/DC converter converts one DC voltage to another DC voltage. A voltage regulator is a circuit which maintains a constant voltage despite variations in load current. Maybe this will help. The DC /DC converter simply steps a raw DC input voltage up or down. Like step-up or step-down transformers , but converters work with DC I/O ( transformers need AC inputs and outputs ) . You can use a voltage regulator after a DC/DC convertor to make the DC output less sensitive to changes in load current Regards , Dangerdave
