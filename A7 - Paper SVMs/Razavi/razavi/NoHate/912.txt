By the way , that wrapping problem with OE is not only annoying for you as the user of the program , it is also annoying for those reading your posts. I wouldnt use the thing if it were the last application on Earth. Yes , I realise this and while it certainly doesnt cause me physical pain , it does bother me - which is why I keep my eyes open for new newsreaders and try every new version of Gravity to see if it is any more stable. Have you tried X-News ? Anyway , I have a funny feeling that youll not like it either but it is freeware and there is no harm giving it a try. I will give it a go cough there is also a windows port of SLRN. : ) Actually slrn is my favourite nix newsreader ( when I have to use one ) .
