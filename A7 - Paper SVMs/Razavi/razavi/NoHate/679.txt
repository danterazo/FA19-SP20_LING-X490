I am trying to come up with some sort of explanation why our environment appears to have three metric dimensions in addition to the time dimension. Is there a better explanation other than saying it just happened that way ? I dont think so. At least I have not seen any compelling explanation , and have been unable to provide one. Way back in grad school , when I first learned of Hamiltons theorem , I almost immediately thought " Ah Ha ! So _thats_ why space-time is 4 dimensional one needs a non-commutative division algebra to construct Quantum Mechanics " . But I have been unable to carry this any further Hamiltons theorem ( loosely , from memory ) : there are exactly three division algebras over the field of the reals : the reals , the complex numbers , and the quaternions. Of these only the last is non-commutative , and it is of 3 + 1 dimensions .
