" To be is to do " -Socrates " To do is to be " -Plato " Scoobee doo bee doo " - Frank Sinatra I saw the lightning people are talking about. It was during the earthquake that happened about 30 mins ago , 2 : 45am. There was maybe 4 or 5 flashes in the west sky during the shaking and rolling. There was no thunder associated w/ the light flashes .
