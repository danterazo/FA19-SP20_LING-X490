Does anybody know a way to network a computer with Windows 98 to a computer with Windows 95 on the same telephone line. I dont have network cards just my modems. I want to be able to share files and printers. Any help would be much appreciated. Even if you can get the computers to communicate through their modems , the speed is likely to be disappointing for file and printer sharing. Get a home phone line networking kit. They provide high speed networking over ordinary phone lines. For information on home phone line networking Reviews , Networking , Telephone Wire.
