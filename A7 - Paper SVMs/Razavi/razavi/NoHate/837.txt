Even so , there were thousands of PPC accelerators sold ( I cant remember how many ) so 200 pre-payments is a pretty poor show. Microcode Solutions could have made much more money by ditching the Amiga and going over to the PC. They must be considering it now given the apparent lack of interest in Amiga FusionPPC and PCxPPC. They have to get their beer money from somewhere ! Thats not an apparent lack of interest. If a software company asked PC users to pay for software which had not yet been written , on a promise that it would be released by a particular date , I doubt they would get many takers. Desperation should not force us to pay for software which we have no way of knowing if it will be any good. I am sure that if FusionPPC is released at a reasonable price , and proves to be a good product , it will sell well. But until it is released , you really cant complain about Amiga users not supporting it. David Meiklejohn
