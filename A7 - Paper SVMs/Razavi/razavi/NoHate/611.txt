I have no need for sound in DOS. The following lines : SET BLASTER = A240 I7 D3 T4 LH C : \ WINDOWS \ ASP4DOS.COM are automatically written to autoexec.bat , even if I delete them. How do I prevent these lines from being written ? I have the same Problem - if you have I solution , please inform me ! thanx Mark I remd em out. Should look like this : rem SET BLASTER = A240 I7 D3 T4 rem LH C : \ WINDOWS \ ASP4DOS.COM the line above it ( without quotes ) . I dont know why autoexec.bat gets rewritten everytime you reboot , but this works. MT
