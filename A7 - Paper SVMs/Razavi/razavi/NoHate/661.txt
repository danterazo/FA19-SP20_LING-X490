I am willing to bet that there are more inmate assaults on staff , than staff assaults on inmates. I would have to agree with that. I am willing to bet more inmates kill staff than staff kill inmates. This I doubt highly , in the entire time I was in I saw 3 fatal shootings from the rail and tower , killing 3 inmates , but only 1 killing of a c/o by inmates. I am willing to bet there are more inmate on inmate assaults than staff on inmate assaults , No doubts there at all. But then again you guys are supposed to be the good guys so it should be that way , dont you think ? and I am willing to bet there are more inmate on inmate murders than staff on inmate murders. Just refer to the above comment same thing applies. Sincerely Risk
