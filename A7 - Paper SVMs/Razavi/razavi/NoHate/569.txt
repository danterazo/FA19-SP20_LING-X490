I vote for Contax. They are excellent bodies , built very well and intuitive to use. The lenses are of ( or very close to ) Leica quality , and many of them are of ( or close to ) Nikon price. I am curious why you want to only look at the most expensive bodies when you are looking for the best lenses ? Consider the RX and give yourself another $ 1k or so for a great lens .
