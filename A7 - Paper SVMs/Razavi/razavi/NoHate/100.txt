Well , since it wasnt intended as a joke , then obviously I dont understand what you were saying. It sounded like you had a Moire pattern generator. If thats not the case , then I would be very pleased to be enlightened as to exactly what it was you were referring to. Oh ! I am sorry. I thought you were being sarcastic because I dont see any value in a moire pattern generator for its own sake. I was of hardware device if thats what you thought I meant ( I dont even know what such a piece of hardware would be , other than a couple of pieces of window screen placed over each other ) . The program creates a circular moire pattern , which looks a lot like a magnetic field. I was asking if this can be used as some kind of geometric model for electromagnetism. It probably has no practical value but it looks interesting , and I never heard of any reference to this phenomenon. QBASIC comes with DOS 5 and 6 and Win 95 and 98 , but with Win 9x it doesnt install by default - you have to go to the " OLDMSDOS " folder on the CD and copy the files to the C : \ WINDOWS \ COMMAND folder. Actually this will work with older BASIC variants from MS but youll have to change to " SCREEN 9 " for lower resolution. = start program = SCREEN 12 CLS y = 300 r = 4 WHILE r 500 r = r 1.03 + 1 adding 1 makes the center of the diagram less crowded x = 250 CIRCLE ( x , y ) , r , 7 x = 350 CIRCLE ( x , y ) , r , 7 WEND = end program
