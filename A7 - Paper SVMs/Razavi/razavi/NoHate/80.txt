What ´ s the best settings for the BVision ? I have a SVGA monitor and a 1084S for old games ! CGFX installation defaults are usually more than enough to get you going but you are sure to want to tweak them later. Youll need all the timing parameters from your SVGA monitors manual to help you work them out. Lyndon ( Wondering whether CGFX 4.1 is worth getting as he is still using the CGFX that came with his BVision ) Before you buy .
