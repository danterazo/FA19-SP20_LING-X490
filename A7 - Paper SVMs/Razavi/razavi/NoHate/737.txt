Hi , No there is only a G version of this lens. There are no optic differences with previous versions , only mechanical ones making the lens focus faster ( higher gear ratios ) . Tryphon does Minolta make a G version and a non-g version of this lens ? is there any difference if one is an older model in terms of optics ? thanks
