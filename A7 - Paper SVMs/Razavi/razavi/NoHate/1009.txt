[ snip ] The Bios wont auto detect past 2 gigs. [ snip ] Why not see if there is a BIOS update for it ? Might be the best solution. Klaatu barada nikto Actually , thats what I did. I had managed to kludge together a system , but it was obviously not happy. I have never " flashed " anything before so was hesitant , plus I didnt know who the MB manufacturer was. But. by using a meta search engine with some key words I knew about the MB I found a site that listed model numbers ( I had a model number , but no maker name ! ? ! ) with the maker. Once I figured out the MB was made by Asus the rest was easy. So thanks for the reply. Now that I have done it I realize it was nothing to get worried about. Seth
