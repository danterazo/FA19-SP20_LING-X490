I cant find any references to setup ( expected directories , etc ) and several searches of DEJA didnt bring up anything I could hang my hat on. What is the proper setup for GhostScript under XFree86 ? Is it possible to use a later version of GhostScript ( without compiling the code ) ? Yeah. There is 5.50. In this version you cant use anti-aliasing in X however. Have a look at Christian Hennecke Keep passing the open windows ! ( " The Hotel New Hampshire " , John Irving )
