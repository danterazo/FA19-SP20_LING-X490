PZ , I believe in evolution , I believe that species evolve over time , however , how does one make the leap from animal ( animal ) to man ? Isnt a man inherently distinguishable from an animal ? No. How about in terms of reasoning faculties ( at least among those born under the " chosen " Astrological signs chuckle ) Are dolphins inherently distinguishable from fish ? Yes. Are they both still animals ? Yes. But a person has a higher reasoning faculty , a conscious & a spirit. A person might share some quality with other animals , but is still very different from them. I disagree. Humans have many obvious differences from other animals , but we are still animals. we are very special animals , if you like. Religion has actually convinced people that there is an invisible man , living in the sky , who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of 10 things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these 10 things , he has a special place full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever til the end of time.but he loves you.
