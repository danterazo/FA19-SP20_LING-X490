Geez , this is a long thread. but I would like to add my $ 0.02 also. Greg , you didnt really give enough information regarding the condition of the rim and the alleged defect. I would be wary of riding a wheel that took 3 hours to build because of this problem. Your LBS should have caught this before building the wheel. Kevin is a good person. I have had several dealings with him and all went very well. He is honest and very considerate. Like many others who have spoken before me , I would not hesitate to do business with Kevin again. Sometimes peoples true intent isnt well communicated by email - one of the problems with this wonderful and still relatively new technology. Hopefully , what you thought was " smug and arrogant " was just unfortunate miscommunication. BTW , if you dont think Kevins prices are reasonable , you have the option not to buy from him. it is not fair to complain about this part of the deal when you bought the rim anyway. Stuart Winsor
