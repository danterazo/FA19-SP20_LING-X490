what would you do if you didnt pontificate about armchair socialism on alt.punk so often ? Eat more food ? Sleep more ? Ah , all worthy pursuits. If I could find some wealthy person to pay me to do these two things , plus read , watch movies/tv , and ride my bike , I might just be as happy as happy could be. Or I could actually do my job. Bah , who wants to do that ? The only thing we probably solidly have opposing views on is the quality of music produced by the Promise Ring. ; Well , since you are always raving about them. . . well i must have missed that memo. Memo ? I am sure you know all about these Mr. Corporate Lawyer Lackey Dude. it is a term of endearment. I am just conversing with you the way I do with most folks. If I really didnt like you I would just ignore you. The way he will this post. Troy kidding
