One of the true great industralists of the 20th century ( who else is left ? ) . RIP. I agree with Terry again ; maybe this is was foreseen by Nostradamus , but the quatrains are unclear. Sonys worldwide influence is incredible ; growing up when I did , the idea that RCA Victor would be thrown on the scrap heap of history ( more or less ) was inconceivable , but it is just a minor player now , and Sony and Philips are much more pervasive. As for great industrialists , is Gianni Agnelli ( head of Fiat ) still with us ? Does one of our experts on the aged recognize the name ? MattH
