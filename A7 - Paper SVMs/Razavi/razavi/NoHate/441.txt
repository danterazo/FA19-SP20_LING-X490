Marcel , Thanks for posting this. Just one small comment to those who made the original pledge : ( And anyone else who is interested in FusionPPC. ) I know that the Blittersoft request to make good on your pledge came at a bad time for the Amiga in general , and it is not an easy decision. I went ahead with my order for a few reasons : 1 ) I made a promise , and I expect a good product in return. I think that Jim has gone beyond the call of duty to pledge that Fusion PPC will be completed ( by Nov 20 ) , despite falling short of the pre-order goal. 2 ) I havent even bought a PPC board yet ( I have been waiting for Fusion PPC ) to put it to good use. If you are thinking of jumping ship to the Mac , you may as well get FusionPPC , and still be able to hold on to your Amiga dreams. 3 ) There is still hope for the Amiga , esp. PPC/QNX based systems. Perhaps this hope is even better now that Gateway is offically out of the picture. This is a message from Paul Lesurf of Blittersort posted to the Fusion Mailing List ; . If you did pledge your suppport to pre-pay Fusion PPC and have not done so , please reconsider and do so now. Best wishes , Paul Lesurf Blittersoft Rhett R. Rodewald Have you written your own real-time OS lately ? ? ? Conways Law : In every organization there will always be one person who knows what is going on. This person must be fired .
