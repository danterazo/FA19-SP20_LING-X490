Peter , Based on experience with other MS products , you will probably have to install DOS / Win3.11 on a system , restore your backups , then copy the files to the new system. MS has consistently not allowed one to restore files backed up with an earlier version of the operating system. This is known as a " FEATURE " . Bill On Thu , 14 Oct 1999 GMT , Peter Province Help ! I am trying to restore an old backup created under Windows 3.11 ( that I thought was created via MSBackup ) to my new W98 machine. The original diskettes contain one file each diskette ( files named cc70827b with 001-027 extensions. The restore operation doesnt find any backup sets , though. Anybody have any advice ? Thanks.
