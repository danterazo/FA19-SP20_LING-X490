Woaaa ! Take that to the bike shop. You need a headset press and a race set. If you dont get the bearing cups in straight you could ruin your headset and your frame. Spend a couple of bucks and let the shop do it. Dave I bought a Titanium GT road frame ( 97 Ti Edge ) and Tange cassette headset. Now , I tried to install the headset , but it was almost impossible to install it with my hand or rubber hammer. Is there anytool that I can use to ease the job ? I worry if I crack my frame during the installation. Thank you , Jason
