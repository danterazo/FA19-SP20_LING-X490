The only documentation I got with an OPL3 was a Word document on a CD and none of the tables had their contents. I want to switch from speaker ( amplified output ) to line out ( unamplified ) . I can see it is J1 but not how it should be set. Simply removing it I just get the RH channel. Anyone able to look up the setting please ? I will need to know the make of the Card. Was this an XWAVE card ? I can tell if it still has Jumpers its and ISA Slot. If need be go to the Yamaha web site and see if you can figure out the manufacturer. Yamaha does not actually make them. Thanks. The only extra information I have to hand is that it is apparently an SI-719 Yamaha 719 ISA. I have tried the main Yamaha web site and cant find anything relevant so far. The Yamaha web site seems very limited unfortunately. John
