I have heard that if there is an earthquake , you are supposed to stand in the doorway of whatever room you are in. I havent been in any big earthquakes , but this makes me wonder. First of all , how many people can you fit into one doorway ? If a room has ten people and one door , it is going to be a bit of a struggle to get that prime doorway position , isnt it ? Secondly , a doorway is just a hole. I realise that doorways have lots of bracing around them , but once the building collapses , I dont think the doorway is going to be left standing. Now as I said , I havent been in any big earthquakes ( I think the largest was a number 4 ) . Can somebody who has been in a big earthquake where buildings collapse tell me : Do the doorways magically remain standing with people sheltering in them when the building collapses ? Or is the " shelter in the doorway " advice JUST A LITTLE BIT SILLY ? Also , does it really work if you are in an elevator plummeting to the bottom of the shaft to jump just before it hits ? I saw an elevator safety poster that said that you should watch the indicator and jump just before the lift gets to the first floor or the ground floor ( depending which country you are in ) . Has anybody tried this ? Enquiring minds want to know ! THAadvanceNKS ! beable van polasm _Have_you_SMASHED_the_STATE_today ? S_M_A_S_H__T_H_E__S_T_A_T_E_ ! __L_E_G_A_L_I_Z_E__C_R_I_M_E_ !
