I once made the mistake of loading Afterdark onto my windows 95 computer. I have deleted every Afterdark file I can find , but lurking somewhere in the entrails are instructions to the system about all the afterdark files that are no longer on my system. I have scoured win.ini , autoexec.bat , config.sys , etc. FirstAid 95 , for example , identifies the 100 or so disconnected afterdark files that I dont have. How do I get rid of every last vestige of this dark menace ? Posted via CNET Help.com
