Does anyone have a sample of this program C + + ? Hmmm , " Bridges of Hanoi " . Thats a new one for me. Is it anything like the " Towers of Koenigsberg " problem ? : Yes. It goes like this : You have 3 bridges in a town called Hanoi. You have to transport them from one shore to the other and have a boat with you which can transport only 2 bridges at the same time. But you have to be careful. If you leave one bridge at the shore , a magician , Mr. David Copper-Euler , pops up and transforms the bridge into the statue of liberty , which vanishes immediately. Sorry. Could not resist : I thought nearly the same when I read the OP , but couldnt remember the name of the town , where Euler situated his bridge-problem. Thank you. Karl Heinz Buchegger
