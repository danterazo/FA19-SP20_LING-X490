I am trying to set of a session whereby the user is on-line already and fills in text boxes on a form which lumps the text box data together and places it all in an Email body and posts it , all in the background. Whats the simplest way to do this ? I have been trying to get the MAPI controls working but if I set the MAPI new session to False I get an error and setting it to True kicks of the Microsoft Mail Controls as a second session. Not useful if already on-line with an ISP. We also have a commercial package which includes components for SMTP , POP3 and MIME which would make things Thanks David but I should have completed the subject header properly ! I am sure there is a way to Auto-post Email using the controls bundled with VB5. It seems silly to just have to go out and download something else if there is something that can do it. Richard.
