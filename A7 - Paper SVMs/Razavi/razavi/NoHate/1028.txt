- " The file PMMERGE-PMVIOP.122 specified in the PROTSHELL statement on line -2 of the CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a valid program. Do you have Process Commander installed ? If the answer is yes then you have to run some obscure PC command to reinstall its hooks ( something like PCINSDLL ? ) . IF you use PC then you should really uninstall it before you apply the FP then reinstall afterwards. No , no PC here. I tried to restore PMMERGE from the previous version , but then it gave me errors in another DLL ; clearly not only PMMERGE but all the DLLs it calls could have been afflicted. So I reinstalled , and applied FP6 , but Netscape 4.61 refuses to run. According to the installation notes , FP5 is the minimum required , so 6 should be OK. I do have Java 1.1.8 and I have removed mentions of javaos2 from the various paths. Pierre Pierre Jelenc | The Cucumbers " Total Vegetility " is out ! | Pawnshops " Three Brass Balls " is out !
