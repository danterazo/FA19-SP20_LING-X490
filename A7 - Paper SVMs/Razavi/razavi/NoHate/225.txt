that stuff is spreading like a weed.2 summers ago I would never heard of it , and now it seems to pop up everywhere. Yup.it is at pretty much every restaraunt and bar down in albuquerque now. Generally on tap. I think it is got a good taste and I am not the biggest ale fan in the world. I have been getting to try lots of great beers for free lately - archaeologists are alkies and beer snobs. I have converted everyone I know into a beer snob. it is so easy to just put my homebrew in front of them and say " drink this " and then they say " wowthats good. " Instant conversion to beer snob. I think if you are not a beer snob you just are lacking SOMETHING. I refuse to settle for PBR Zac
