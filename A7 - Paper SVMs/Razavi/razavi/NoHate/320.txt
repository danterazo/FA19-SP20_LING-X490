says. How about posting a small routine or code excerpt which exhibits the problem ? . If youve followed my posts lately , youll note that the source codes are available at . The operative words are " small " , " routine " and " excerpt. " You need to isolate the smallest possible example that exhibits the problem. Then it will be a lot easier to get help. Usually , when I have a problem such as yours , and I isolate the example as described , by the time I get a small example that works , I understand the problem. it is nearly always some problem in my code. The fact that some compilers accept it anyway is irrelevant. OTOH , if the compiler is really at fault , the small excerpt will make that obvious. I support a large code that has been ported to just about every commercial UNIX. Despite every attempt to write portable code , there are bugs in the code that turn up with every port. There are occasionally compiler bugs that turn up too , and one time there was even a problem that have turned up where the F90 standard was not completely clear , and the compiler implementer interpreted it one way and I interpreted it another way. ( They ended up agreeing with me on that one , BTW. : ) But in many cases , understanding could not have been achieved working on the whole code. Since you know your code better than anyone else , you are in the best position to carry out this process of simplification. The fact that several compilers fail on your code increases the likelihood that the problem is with the code. Nuff said , -P .
