2108 is great , but I actually prefer to go passive and use Bryston amps. Even so , the amplifiers in the VS2108s work a lot better than what you usually get in powered nearfields. No limiting. And the low end of the speaker is more useful too , though you may want a sub in larger applications , depending on the room. All IMO , of course. Chris
