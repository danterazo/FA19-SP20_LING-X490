Which is more efficient at producing energy from the sun ? Would it make sense to let plants collect the sunrays and then perform chemical processes on the plants to extract the energy ? Z Do you mean like growing trees and burning the wood ? : Sure but it takes a fair bit of effort to get the plant energy into forms readily usable by society , on top of the fact that the best land for growing many plants is often where we want to grow food. But to answer your first question IIRC the efficiency of the best solar cells is now somewhere in the vicinity of a bit over 20 % ( I am sure someone will correct me by posting the latest record or something ) but I dont know what the equivalent figure is for plants. I imagine it depends on the type of plant and how it is used for energy , e.g. corn turned into ethanol gives one efficiency , trees turned into firewood another , but I really dont know for sure. You also have to figure in the energy required to produce the energy ( manufacturing solar cells versus planting , havesting , processing , etc. for plants ) if you want the total picture. At this time there is some energy produced both ways , so they are technically feasible in some sense , but neither has been cheap enough to gain a large market share. Regards , Russell Martin
