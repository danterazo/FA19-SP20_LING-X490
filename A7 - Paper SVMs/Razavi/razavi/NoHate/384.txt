On Fri , 1 Oct 1999 -0600 , " Lt. Wilkes " Pokemon Tampons. Thoughts ? Opinions ? Suggestions ? They already have these in Japan. Indeed they do. And " Hello Kitty Pads " too. I was in a convenience store with a CHYK and I saw a plastic package with a picture of Hello Kitty on it. So I said " Kitty ! " and reached to pick it up. She slapped my hand down and shouted " NO ! " . Later I went back to the store without her and looked at the packet to determine that they were those little mouse pillow pads that women like to use. So , did you buy them and show them to your CHYK ? That would have brought on a wave of shame even time cant cure. cheers beable van polasm Reverend DragonSpirit
