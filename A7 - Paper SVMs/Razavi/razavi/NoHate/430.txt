Money from who ? Thats my question. Mine too. there is been times TAC could have used some money , but we made it through those times despite ourselves. : Maybe it will work. maybe not. Maybe history has shown it cant. : But we just dont know. There are no guarantees. I havent seen him Apparently , there is at least one guarantee , you just made it. That Gary has good intentions ? Right. It just seemed a funny , sweeping generalization to makethat life has no guaranteesshortly after youd made one. I also find this funny. You made a sweeping generalization by attaching TAC to some request for money , then talk about someone elses sweeping generalizations ? Impugn away Jason , with or without facts. I know what I have and havent done and " asking for money " is not one of those things. As a journalist , I would hope you would check your facts better than this. Apology accepted however. I know you mean no ill will. Gary Peake , TAC-OwlNet.Net Team AMIGA Central We provide free web sites for small developers Sometimes you are the windshield , sometimes you are the bug !
