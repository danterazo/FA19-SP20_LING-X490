Not sure who asked : Dolores Hope ( May 27 1909 ) ( was she a performer,or just a famous spouse ? ) She was an extremely good lounge singer. She pretty much gave it up when she married Bob. For Bobs 90th birthday , she serenaded him on national TV and she was outstanding. Most older women really loose their ability to sing as they age ; she still sounded very mellow and she was nearly 90 herself at the time. She is also been active in various charitable endeavors.
