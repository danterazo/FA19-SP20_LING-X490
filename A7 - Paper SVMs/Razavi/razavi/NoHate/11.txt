You might be up to something here , but it is not the average temperature. These experiments are done in controlled environment of buildings. If the temoerature had something to do with it in this manner , there would be pronounced difference between day and night weight and between equator and pole weight. There are differences , but nothing of 5 % magnitude. I suppose the weight gain was arived at mathematicaly from the behaviour of the pendulum , rather then from weighing the pendulum on a spring scale. One has to be carefull with drawing the conclusions when mathematics is used. I still think though , that the thermal radiation is the main product of random material behaviour while the gravitation is a different quantum order byproduct. Regards Slavek. Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work. Question ; during a solar eclipse does the average temperature of the environment decrease ? So dont you have in the first case temperature decrease causes weight loss and in the second case temperature decrease causes weight gain ?
