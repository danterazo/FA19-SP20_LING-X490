My last post was sent incomplete , so here is the conclusion. In " Shiva " , the asteroid becomes another saterlite of Earth. The mere fact that the earth has another saterlite would create a disruption , which cant be easily forseen. The moon does create sea tides ; it is impossible to guess what impact the new saterlite , probably called Shiva , would affect the climate , a question the author somehow evades. In " Hammer of God " , the spaceship sent to kill the asteriod instead deflects it over Antarctica , to the dismay of penguins. Unfortunately , that does trigger the meltdown of the ice-cap , which would be likely to produce effects worse than those caused by Shiva. Once again , Arthur Clarke jumps the question. ( In another of his books , the Richter 10 , Clarke does bring the earthquake , but after a new civilization is conveniently built somewhere in outer space. ) IMHO , all three are not adequate. The most likely outcome for an asteroid attack on such magnatitude would be like this : 1. All attempts to kill the star fail. 2. The rock hits the land. 3. A giant explosion opens up every seismic fault on the earth , and every volcano on earth explodes simultaneously. 4. Coastal civilization is dead , of volcanoes , earthquakes , super- tsunamis , etc. 5. The smoke from all these volcanoes lower global temperature , somewhat offsetting the thermal energy unleashed by the collision. The winners ? Most likely , some hill tribes in Tibet or Andes , who are less likely to be affected from the collision than any other races on earth. The survival odds of the United States ? Somewhat higher than Chicago Cubs would win the World Series next year. From Feudalists Dictionary : Patriotism : Giving your life to prolong the terms of your political leaders.
