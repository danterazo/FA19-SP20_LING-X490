How widespread are the large town signs one often sees here , maybe six or eight feet square , with the logos of the Rotary and the Kiwanis and all the other groups of that ilk , indicating where and when they meet ? Well I think of them as Midwestern , so it cant be a California thing ! Unless we have two different phenomena in mind. The displays I have seen have the club badges , each a foot across , attached to the poles of the sign. I never looked close enough to see whether they have useful info on them .
