I can not open certain attachments to my e-mail. The message I get is " No Viewers " and to create an association in Add/Remove by clicking Quick View. When I do , I get the message that I need to insert Windows 95 Disk 21. My Windows was pre-installed in my computer package. My computer is Hewlett Packard Pavilion 7055. Thank you very much.
