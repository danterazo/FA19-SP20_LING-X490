Judity , You have lived a very sheltered life ! LOL ! Not making fun , just teasing. Actually , my folks bought a Beautiful mobile home ( double wide ) here in FL ( for a song ! ) that is in a gorgeous park , two sides of the property surrounded by lake , in an " over 55 " community w/ golf course , two pools , tennis courts , bocci courts , a clubhouse , etc. I am jealous ! My dad , retired carpenter , redid the floors ( wood ) and also redid the kitchen. The house is amazing. The have a Florida room addition and also a garage. Cant beat it w/ a stick. Boy have Trailers changed ! steph . c ourse , we live in Hurricane Country , which is a little scary. Is a trailer park the same as a mobile home park ? My best friend out here in CA lives in a narrow single-width mobile home in a local park which also has some smaller units throughout it. Why would anybody look down on people living in these parks , particularly with the cost of housing out here nowadays ? I would never heard the term " trailer park trash " before. Am I missing some important point here ? Judity
