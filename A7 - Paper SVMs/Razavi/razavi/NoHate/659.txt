I attended the game , so here are my thoughts. Ok , this game was a good one , despite the holdouts and injuries. Kevin Weekes played well. Maybe not as well as the shouting commentators described it , but he made the saves. If we can have two skilled goaltenders doing the job this year , I think we might be in business. He stole the game for us , more or less. He was generally quite good , if a little flamboyant and lucky. I thought that defense was patchwork and that it would fail , but I liked what I saw in Hawgood , Joseph and Bodger. They are no superstars , but they seem to have done their job tonight. Maybe it is just me , but it might hold until guys like Aucoin and Ohlund come back. What they did well was clearing the puck out of the zone. the mistakes were not as numerous as last year. The defense , to me , looked fairly porous. Jovanoski was a monster , trying to hit everything that moved , but seemed incapable of generating any offense. Chris Joseph , while alright in the offensive zone , looked particularly mediocre in his own zone. Baron has acquired the dreaded Murzyn syndrome , taking penalties because he cant keep up with the opposition. What about those last five minutes ? They kept the Rangers OUT OF THE ZONE , which was what I doubted they could ever do. What most impressed me tonight was that the team looked better coached than it has in years. Lines were well-managed , the break-outs were relatively clean , and they ( particularly the third line ) cycled the puck well. With the exception of Messier , the forwards seemed to be back-checking well. One player that surprised me tonight was Peter Schaefer. With limited ice-time he stood out and played a complete game. He was rewarded with a couple of shifts with Messier , powerplay and penalty-killing time and an assist. He certainly looked encouraging. The same could be said for Chubarov , who was less impressive ( and a bit gawky ) but not out of place. DB .
