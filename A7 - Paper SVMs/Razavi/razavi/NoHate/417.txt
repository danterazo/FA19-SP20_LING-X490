Nikon 35-70 2.8 vs Nikon 28-105 I have owned the 35-70 2.8 , and sold it because I found the zoom range not very useful. In addition it is a very heavy lens for its range all of the 2.8s are heavy lenses , and certainly worth owning for fine photography , but this is not a great travel lens for most non pros. I do own , and constantly constantly my 28-105 Nikon , and , though it is slightly slower , I love the lens. It has a good range. It is light weight. The lens is versatile ( also doubling as a pretty good macro ) and my results have been sharp. All advice must be taken in the context of who gives it. I am far from a pro , but I am a pretty decent amateur. Good luck .
