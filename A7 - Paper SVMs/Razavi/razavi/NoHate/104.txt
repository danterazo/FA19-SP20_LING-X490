Well , actually I am trying at old age to recover enough brain cells to go back to grad school in physics. I am a little slower , but I can tell a bad problem , and H&R 4 probably has more than its share. And several of them were not corrected from Edition 3. The grossness of some of these errors is rather appalling , as is the attitude of the publisher. And , of course , there is no erratta ( sp ? ) sheet - it would be many , many pages. jrc For what it is worth , I am struggling right now with a textbook problem , and I finished my Ph.D. in theoretical physics twenty-five years ago ! ( true , it is a " double starred " problem , but it is still a freshman problem. ) Well , dont leave us in suspense which problem ? So far , my fave freshman problem is the spring-with-mass from H&R that passed muster as a comprehensive exam problem at one time. Commercial e-mail is _NOT_ that resolves to my account for any reason at any time .
