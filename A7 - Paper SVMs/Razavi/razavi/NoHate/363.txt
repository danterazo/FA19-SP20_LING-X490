One of the mcdojos in town puts a black belt up on the wall for you when you join the " black belt club. " The idea is that it is a constant reminder of your goal ( to which I think , shouldnt your goal be to become a powerful martial artist ? But I digress ) but for the guy walking in the door , the impact instead is " wow , this must be a great school , look at all the black belts. " The school I belong to does this with almost the same name etc. but it is pointed out that before the belt is really yours you have to earn it. The belts are put on a little plaque which has a nice saying on it and the belts are left in their wrappings even. No one with even a smidge of sense would ever think that these belts were actually worn by anyone. If and when you pass your grading & just before you receive your belt at the " show grading " your belt is removed from the wall with its plaque. The belt is embroidered and then at the proper moment you receive both at the final ceremony. .Tom .
