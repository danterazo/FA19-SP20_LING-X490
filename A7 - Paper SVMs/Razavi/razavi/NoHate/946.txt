Are you suggesting that someone should NOT file legitimate claims or legitimate lawsuits because it might affect their future employment ? Not at all. I would be want to be darn well sure that I had a legitimate claim. If I refused to do my job and got fired because of it , I dont think I would be yelling " wrongful termination " . Not saying that this is what happened , but I have known of a lot of lawsuits have been filed that were unfounded. Carol American by birth. Southern by the grace of God .
