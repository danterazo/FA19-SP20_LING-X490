Good combo , but then start making interactive sites with hundreds of pages. Knowing that you can cut and paste , throw templates across multiple pages in one pass , support nested tables and layers properly , etc makes a growing site like Owlnet turn from an abomination to do into something much easier. I agree that smaller sites with less than 15 pages are fun to code by hand , but add another 100 plus pages to that with limited time to get them all out and you can see my frustration. Dream Weaver , for instance , can take a template site wide in about 1 minutes with a large site , almost as a batch process. Now do that by hand to change one silly thing " like copyright 1998-1999 " to " copyright 1998-2000 " and do it over 150-200 pages. : ( Could look at WebLord made by Udo Scheurman. Both a Linux and Amiga version. Surf to decent and Amigan to boot. Not too bad actually !
