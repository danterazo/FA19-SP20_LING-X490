I have a kewl new search-form for Deja that I am putting together : Would some of you guys and gurls like to try it out , and let me know if you find any bugs ? Also , let me know if you have any suggestions for extra features I could add ? Make your " keywords " submission box fill a full screen. Delete one date box , leaving only " from " . Make alt.food.peeps your example group. Captain Infinity
