Stefan : The VB setup wizard adds that install program SETUP.EXE to your install set. It is true , you can not modify its behavior directly. However , SETUP calls a program named SETUP1.EXE and it is a VB program , for which you should have the source code. At least it comes with the VB professional versions. You can modify SETUP1.EXE to do what you want the installation to do.
