I see Pocono has put up some info on the new TeleVue 31.5 mm ep. Hefty price tag though. I think this would be the perfect ep for my 10 " LX200. I want one. So do I . and by sheer luck I am driving right past them today on the way to my sister-in-laws birthday party , so I can stop in for their TeleVue day festivities with Al and David Nagler onsite. I hope the " specials " include the 31.5mm , BinoVue and EverBright at NEAF-eyepiece-sale-like discounts. Anyone giving odds on that ? John
