Certainly the site is dedicated to the Meade ETX ( originally a single model , now a product line ) . My point exactly. I would think that you would recognize that , as the host of the website , it would be poorly advised for you to speak ill of another manufacturers competing product unless you were willing to be labeled as a Meade representative ( which is obviously the case ) . It would have been perfectly appropriate for you to have Meade people over and have a look how great the ETX line is party. But when you brought the competitor into it , particularly without being fair and thorough , and then put them down , you opened yourself up to the criticism. You have a certain amount of influence with your website , and you need to be careful how you conduct yourself if you care what others think. If it is an authorized Meade site , then , so be it , there is then no reason for you to defend yourself at all. rat ( ) ;
