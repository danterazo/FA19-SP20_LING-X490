did the 60s start in 1960 ? Actually , the 60s started in 1963 and lasted until around 1975. did the 90s start in 1990 ? The 90s didnt really kick in until 1991 : The Gulf War , the launch of Wired magazine , the rise of Nirvana I suppose one could argue that the Twentieth Century didnt really begin until 1914 or so .
