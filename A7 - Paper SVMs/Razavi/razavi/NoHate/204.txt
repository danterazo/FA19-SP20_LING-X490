The one attribute that is doubly specified is dummy argumentness. The variable is in the argument list ( where else ? ) and also must be typed and have an intent declared ( unless it is a pointer ) . I dont see an easy way to avoid that. Well , other languages provide a way ( in pseudo-Fortran ) : SUBROUTINE ABC ( REAL,INTENT ( IN ) : A , INTEGER,INTENT ( OUT ) : I ) Whether you consider this " and easy way " to avoid the duplication is a matter of taste. I cant decide whether I like it or not. J. Giles
