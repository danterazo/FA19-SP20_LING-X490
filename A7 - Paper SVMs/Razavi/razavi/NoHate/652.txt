I cant give you an immediate answer on this , but my dad has Works on his computer too. He is the secretary of his masonic lodge and does a mailing every single month. I will be with him this weekend and will find out how he does it. My dad has Microsoft Works , which I believe came with his computer. Anyway , does anyone know how to do mass mailing out of this. What he wants is to print envelopes , where the computer pulls addresses from his address book and just plugs them in. Does anyone know how to do this ? TIA :
