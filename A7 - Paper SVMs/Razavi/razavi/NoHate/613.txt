I have installed StarOffice and want to give it a try. But it doesnt convert my Lotus WordPro files ( it just launches WordPro when I try to open them. ) Whats the best way to get them in ? Should I " save as MSWord " from Wordpro ? Or RTF ? Or AmiPro ? Or is it supposed to be able to convert them directly ? John Abraham , M.Sc. P.Eng. T.J. Modelling Ltd. Mathematical Modelling for Transportation Planning and Urban Design I havent tried it , but RTF ( Rich Text Format ) seems to work well for converting between programs ( in general ) . Sometimes , you need to try more than one way to find the best conversion path. Hope this helps. From the PC of Doug Bissett doug.bissett at attglobal.net
