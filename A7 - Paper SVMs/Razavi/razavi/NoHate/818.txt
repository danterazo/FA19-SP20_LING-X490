Forgive me for jumping in here , but I am perplexed by the " facts " in this case , and would like someone to explain to me how all of this could have occurred. The seller sold what he believed to be a brand new rim. The buyer after receiving the rim and after visually inspecting it carefully , was satisfied and took it to his LBS to have it built. The mechanic says the rim was " in pretty bad shape , had been banged around a lot " , but built it up anyway. Then the mechanic is forced to spend 4x as long as normal to build it up and get it trued and tensioned properly , but in spite of his best efforts,the wheel is still of mediocre quality. Now everyone concerned is unhappy , and all over $ 25. Now , I have been riding a long time and I have owned lots of wheelsets. I think I would know the difference between a new , true rim and one which had been beat up , bent , etc. just by looking at it. How did this rim pass visual inspections by 3 experienced people ( as well as by the manufacturer ) , only to be pronounced N.F.G. after the wheel was finished ? I mean , how could such a poor rim not appear to have any obvious defects beforehand ? If it was warped or out of round , or there were burrs in the spoke holes or loose eyelets , or a flat spot , or the seam joint was rough , wouldnt it have been apparent to someone ? Michael
