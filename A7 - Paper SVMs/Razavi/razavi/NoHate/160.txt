This madness ( 31.5 Type 5 ) has to stop g. We are all going to be in the poor house. $ 200 , then $ 300 , then $ 400 , then $ 500 + eyepieces. Where will it end ? Hello , Need to thank Al Nagler for this price madness , with the new Type 5 at about $ 600 I do net feel guilty anymore for paying $ 425 for a Zeiss Ortho few monts ago. I wonder what a Type 6 is going to cost ? Keep balancing that checkbook. Thanks , Vahe
