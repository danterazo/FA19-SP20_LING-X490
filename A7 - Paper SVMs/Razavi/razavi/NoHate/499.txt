Is there a way of changing the icons Windows uses for folders , to a custom icon of my own creation ? To change the icon for a single folder : Create a file DESKTOP.INI file in the folder , which contains : [ .ShellClassInfo ] IconFile = { name and path of the file , which contains the icon } IconIndex = xx InfoTip = { An optional description for the folder that displays in web view when selected } where " xx " is the number of the icon to be used from the defined file ( where the first icon has the number 0 ) . After you have created the DESKTOP.INI , open a DOS box and set the " S " attribute for the same folder : ATTRIB { dirname } + S To change all folder icons : Open the Explorer , go View Folder Options File Types and scroll down the list to the " File Folder " entry. Press " Edit " " Change Icon " ( tm )
