CGFX installation defaults are usually more than enough to get you going but you are sure to want to tweak them later. Youll need all the timing parameters from your SVGA monitors manual to help you work them out. Lyndon ( Wondering whether CGFX 4.1 is worth getting as he is still using the CGFX that came with his BVision ) Hard to say. It is a little quicker at screen switching ( so your monitor may not need to re-sync anymore when you switch between screens of similar resolution ) and it cleared up some graphical problems I was having with MUI apps. Also , it lets you use the video overlay function that some MPEG players use which is really cool. If none of this appeals to you , you may be as well sticking with CGX3 .
