Sorry , did you just call Baron huge ? ? Ha. He looks like a chicken to me , especially when he skates. I think any of Baron , York or Klatt are perfect waiver bait. Josh Not to HEAP praise on the guy , but Baron wasnt a problem for the team IMO. I think he is bearing the brunt of the disappointment in being Burkes only FA signing of last year. Being ridiculously overpaid is not his fault. he is a huge guy with veteran experience and pretty good straight-ahead speed. Klatt scored a few goals in preseason and could be better this year. it is Harry York who needs a wakeup call. The fastest and easiest way to search and participate in Usenet - Free !
