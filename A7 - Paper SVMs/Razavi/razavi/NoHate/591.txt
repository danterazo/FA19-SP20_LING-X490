I really do not know. I upgraded my PageMaker just to get it : it was cheaper than to get Acrobat. Anyway , it is annoying to have to rebbot to Win95 , but I only work there fore the 30 seconds it takes to creat a 200 pages pdf-file. One reasonable idea is to send a postscriptfile to someone who has destiller , and he can easily do it. I would be happy to help out. Thanks ! I will store your e-mail address in a safe place. I will get back to you be e-mail when the time comes , if it is ok. V ? nta lite nu , va. Du har ju en .se. Och fint namn har du ocks ? . : /j
