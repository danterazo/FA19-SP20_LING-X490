It is for everybody who uses WIN98 ( SE too ! ) and whos joystick is listed as " not connected " . The updated virtual display driver is called sw3dpro.vxd version 3.00.01. One should also download the latest game controller software : SWGameEN.exe ( version 3.02 ) Thanks for posting some filenames ; time to " venture " into MS-world , and find this sucker. For some reason , I have a really hard time finding anything at MS , file-name searches always seem to give " zero " results. Btw , I found the same filename with HotBot , but am not sure it is the lastest driver. it is worth the try though , will get the file from HotBot and see if it is v3.02 or newer ( about 6mb DL ) .
