And what would cause any thinking person not to accept the ether approach ? The only thing that could prevent any thinking person from accepting the ether approach would be if they did not understand the ether approach. And any person who really knew SR should almost instantly be able to understand the ether. Therefore , I ask you , how could anyone , on this net , really reject the ether ? Well let me start. You expect me to believe in a substance that has never been observed. Furthermore you expect me to believe in a substance whose existence is refuted by an several experiments among which are the Noble-Trouten Experiment and the Michael son Morley Null result ( which was not their intent by the way ) . You expect me to believe there exists a substance which is stiffer than steel and rarer than the thinnest gas. You expect me to believe space is filled with something that does not slow planets down or exchange any energy with them. In short you expect me to believe in something that makes less sense than Santa Claus. Bob Kolker
