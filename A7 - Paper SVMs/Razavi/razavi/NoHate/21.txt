you are wrong ; is the magnitude of complex impedance , goes through a maximum. But. I fail to see how a function can have a maximum is the slope is always positive. that way , you can not even have an inflection point. Reactance is the imaginary part of complex impedance , and it is zero at resonance. Or , in the case of parallel resonance , undefined ( actually I prefer the old term infinite , but the PC math folks have brain-washed me ) . Also , as Matty previously did , I would remind the poster of the Tan X function. it is slope is alway positive , yet it is discontinuous , hence not monotonic. Harry C .
