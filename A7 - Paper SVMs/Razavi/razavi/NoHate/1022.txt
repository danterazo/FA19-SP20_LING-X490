. Personally , I think the notion that a compiler can or ought to only see one source file of the program at a time is the anachronism. Yep. The time has come to let the programmer decide the issue , not the language designer or the implementor. There are cases in which the program in question needs all the interprocedural analysis that modern compiler technology can provide. There are other cases in which the programmer desires to save compilation time by limiting interprocedural analysis to link-time and later. It should be the programmers choice. J. Giles
