It is for everybody who uses WIN98 ( SE too ! ) and whos joystick is listed as " not connected " . The updated virtual display driver is called sw3dpro.vxd version 3.00.01. One should also download the latest game controller software : SWGameEN.exe ( version 3.02 ) Can anyone post a direct link to fetch these files ? I found a site , but it was an older version. I cant find " nothn " at MS ( sigh ) . Also , I looked at SWGameEn.exe ; it says it is a game-controller setup for the MS Sidewinder ( even shows a pic of the Sidewinder stick , when installing drivers ) . Does this work with all other type game-devices too ? Also , I am using W95 ( OSR2 ) . Is this file update okay for W95 too ? Thanks , Matt Teehole
