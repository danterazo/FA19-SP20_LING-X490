Feudalist said : It could have ended in Sept 1914 , with things once again returning to " stable and secure " , if an Italian peddlers son didnt spoil the pasta. Logically speaking , the Germans had to expect that if they invaded France : ( 1 ) the French would resist , and ( 2 ) their Schleiffen Plan would not survive ( unmodified ) its contact with the enemy , because ( 3 ) some of the ways in which the French would resist would surprise the Germans. . Perhaps you should instead consider the possible flaws of a German government and military establishment which put its faith in " perfect plans " and failed to consider the possibility that it did not possess a monopoly on initiative or innovation upon the battlefield ? Nah , that would mean realizing that the Second Reich was FLAWED . Actually , according to Keegan , Schleiffen couldnt work through the flaws in the marching plan that was key to getting all the German armies where they needed to be before the French could mobilize and get _their_ troops to the frontiers. In true Micawberish fashion Moltkes staff assumed " something would turn up " . It didnt and the French did. I havent been following this thread because Feudalist is PLONKed here.
