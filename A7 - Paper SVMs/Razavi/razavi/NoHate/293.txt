Some time ago I read an article on EDN by Bob Pease , who suggested using the CD4007 CMOS inverter pairs in an analog way. In this article was also shown the I-V characteristic of such MOS for low currents , but the graph wasnt really precise ( and , after all , I lost this article ) . Could anyone give me an hint or sends me information about using CD4007 in this way ? I always accept hints on methods for getting a precise CD4007 V-I curve for low currents. Why not measure it yourself , it doesnt take that long. You might be interested that the unbuffered version of the 4049 can be used as a MOSFET as well. Regards Rob
