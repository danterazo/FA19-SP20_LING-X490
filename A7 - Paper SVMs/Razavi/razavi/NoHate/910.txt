Can anyone tell me if I should learn C or C + + first ? I have to teach myself and I cant get any college courses. Here are some factors to consider : There are excellent free compilers available for both. There are far more good books about C than about C + + , especially for novice programmers. There is ( so far ) a lot more sample code , helpful web sites , programmer utilities , and other useful goodies available for C than C + + , though the gap is closing. Any C + + programmer can help you with C. Many C programmers can not help you with C + + ( unless they are also C + + programmers ) . C + + is a much larger language than C. Almost everything you learn about C is applicable to C + + , but only a small part of C + + is relevant to C. Because C is a much smaller language , it takes much less time to learn. C + + has largely replaced C in general-purpose programming , and jobwise , you almost have to learn C + + eventually. So consider these things and use your best judgment.
