A complimentary Cc of this posting was sent to Craig Silver I have been out of the OS/2 stream for a few years now - I blame it on work , but thats another thread. My question is about the great browser history feature that I once used in an old OS/2 web browser , the name of which I forget. It was the popular browser back in the Warp days , and you could get a detailed " map " of everywhere youd navigated during a particular session. Does anyone know of an IE or Netscape ( Windows version ) addon that provides this functionality ? I cant believe the Windows world doesnt have this. Or should I be surprised ? Will not directly help you , but I have a working Lynx patch on my disk. I want to make a particular " view " of the history runtime configurable , so it will not make it to the released Lynxen for some time , though. Ilya
