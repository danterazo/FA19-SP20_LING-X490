Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work. Question ; during a solar eclipse does the average temperature of the environment decrease ? So dont you have in the first case temperature decrease causes weight loss and in the second case temperature decrease causes weight gain ?
