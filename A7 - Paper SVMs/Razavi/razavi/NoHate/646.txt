i do that everytime i attempt an install of windows , without fail. it is something that is happening with whatever hard disk is put in there. this happened with the old noisey hard disk too , i.e. the change to the newer hard disk made no difference really. So therefore I am guessing that its a hardware thing , I am gon na try removing the modem and soundcard when installing. but I am pretty sure its something to do with whatever test it does at the point in the installation of windows ( 95 and 98 ) that i mentioned before , or rather what it tests or communicates with. i think that someone with a knowledge of the procedures that windows goes through when installing will be able to help here. Thanks. I had a similar probleming with installing Win98 on a machine which had the last release of Win95 ( the one with USB support ) installed. I even reformatted the whole drive - to no avail. The trick was to re-install Win95 , disable the USB support , format the drive and everything went perfect. I dont know if you are trying to upgrade or just installing Win95 , but it is probably a BIOS thing ( the USB driver from Win95 did something to the BIOS ) . Some computerbrands / types are known to have an Win98 incompatible bios ( Compacq had a lot of trouble with that and released a Compacq version of Win98 ) . So I should suggest checking the bios and the website of the bios/motherboard manufacturer. Pieter
