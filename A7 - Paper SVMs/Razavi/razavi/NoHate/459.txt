Just saw a posting on Suns web page and saw Staroffice for sale for 6.95. Actually the cd comes with three or four ports of the program. Is this collection of things worth getting for OS2 ? I seem to remember reading in the Linux groups that Staroffice ran slowly. Might be wrong though. Any comments ? StarOffice slower on Linux due to static libraries OS/2 uses Dynamic libraries Still an improvement over Office If a million monkeys on typewriters can eventually type out the Bible , given enough time. Then Bill Gates had 25 monkeys and a week !
