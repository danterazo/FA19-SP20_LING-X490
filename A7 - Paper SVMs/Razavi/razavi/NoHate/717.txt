How widespread are the large town signs one often sees here , maybe six or eight feet square , with the logos of the Rotary and the Kiwanis and all the other groups of that ilk , indicating where and when they meet ? Well I think of them as Midwestern , so it cant be a California thing ! Unless we have two different phenomena in mind. The displays I have seen have the club badges , each a foot across , attached to the poles of the sign. I never looked close enough to see whether they have useful info on them. Yeah , those are them. I have seen them in bigger towns and cities , too , but all the bigger ones have that " rural " character that makes it so hard for me to characterize what they are. And the number of clubs represented doesnt seem to correlate with the size of the town. Lots of clubs : Lions , Elks , Moose , IOOF , Woodmen , Rotary , Soroptimists ( women , right , so they are never on the poles ? ) , Sons of the Golden West , etc. it is the highway signs that have the elevation and population.
