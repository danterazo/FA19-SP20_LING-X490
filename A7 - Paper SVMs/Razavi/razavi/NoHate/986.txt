Activicons is a freeware program that will make this easier. It changes both the default yellow folder and individual folder icons. You can Is there a way of changing the icons Windows uses for folders , to a custom icon of my own creation ? When I was using Win 3.1/WFW 3.11 I remeber I had a utility called My Folders or something that could do that , but right now I am not looking for an applet or utility that does this. I want to know if there is a way this can be done just by tweaking Windows directly. ( Even tweaking the Registry in which case , please please be clear. ) .
