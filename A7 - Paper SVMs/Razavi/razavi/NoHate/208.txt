The interference you are receiving may not be in violation of any law , but it I will bet it is very annoying. There are several things you can do to try to protect your TV reception. If you are on cable ; call the cable company to have them check the system. Check all the jumpers between your VCR and TV and cable box and disconnect anything connected to the TV one at a time. Often the VCR is prone to RFI rather than the TV. If you are not on cable , attach a good HI-Pass filter between the antenna and TV. Get square ferrite chokes from radio shack and wrap all of your cables in them. Try to determine where the RF is getting into your system. Is it the AC line , the antenna line , or do you have extension speakers , or a Home Theater sound system hooked to your TV ? Any of these paths can be vulnerable. Start by just watching the TV alone with nothing else in line. Ask your neighbor politely if he will assist in the testing process. He may be a completely legal operator , in which case , YOU need to prevent the interference to your unprotected devices. Contact the manufacturer of your TV. Often they have kits you can install to prevent RFI. The FCC has an interference handbook available , which has lots more ideas. You can probably get info on it at the FCC website. Good Luck !
