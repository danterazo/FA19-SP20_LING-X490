I have a grandfather clock. Since you all seem to be wondering around , I will ask this question thats been on my Lifes Mysteries list. Will my grandfathers clock keep the same time on the moon ? Whats one of Lifes Mysteries to thee Is less of a problem to me : With each tick and each tock Your grandfather clock Measures Two Pi Root L upon g. [ with apologies for the slight paraphrase ] grin This is the very first time that one of my Lifes Mysteries generated a poem. Ok , the ticks will be different on the moon. But the tick adjustment due to a different g wont automagically count off a day ; will it ? For that matter , a day is a very different thing on the moon. How does one define a day. If I wanted to use a base 12 for time divisions , I suppose that I would prefer to mark off a circadean ( sp ? ) rhythm. Now , will the clock mechanism still work ? In other words , does any of the gear movement depend on an atmospheric pressure ? I suppose I wont be able to hear the bongs or the music when the quarter hours are struck. Right ? I guess I will have some problems with the moon phase on the clock face. /BAH Subtract a hundred and four for e-mail .
