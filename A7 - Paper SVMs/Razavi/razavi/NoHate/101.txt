Well , I tried it , and it works somewhat okay. Just have to figure out how to make it do what I want. Thanks ! Erik You may want to take a look at : It purports to be a freeware file compression utility , but I havent tried it yet so cant say if it is any good or not. I am backing up an Access database every hour. Before I back it up , I compact it to help decrease it is size. What I want to do though is to compress it to take up less disk space with some kind of compressor like ZIP , ARJ , etc. Is there any way to do this through VB ? Thanks for any assistance !
