Hello Daniel. When I looked at your site the first time , I indeed missed something. Without really looking closelly , I saw your motion picture as push gravity. Never the less , I still have some reservations. The major one is , that you are producing ever bigger gravitons , which themselves do not have any justification for their speed. Should you use the same principle for them as you use for the photon , you would end up with an infinite fractal sequence of particles. No matter how you skin it , the energy of your interaction must come from somwhere. If you take it from the gravitons , your gravitons will loose their speed on every interaction. I would say that your gravitation should be less on a dayside than on your night side. Another point is the redshift of photon. If it were accelerated instantly by the gravitons , there would be no reason for it. I would almost say that the light should have only one frequency , as your gravitons are supplying energy in abundance. I will have to chew on this one , though. One thing seems to be in contradiction with the approach. It looks like an electron recoils when it radiates a photon. That would mean that the instant speed of light is given by the photon dynamics , rather than being result of interaction with gravitation. Mind you , this is orthodox stuff. But I dont think that they are completely wrong on everything. They do deserve a lot of credit. Otherwise , it seems that you followed the same path for your argumentation that I did , which is common sense. That argumentation of yours is better than anything I have seen so far , and logical all right. Regards Slavek .
