The book may have been " Introduction to Matrix Methods in Optics " , by Gerrard and Burch , now published by Dover. [ edit ] Thanks for the very insteresting response. Can I infer reading between the lines that there isnt too much " online " about this and that the book listed is about the only one now available on the subject ? Thanks again ! Before you buy .
