I am using a linked list that I would like to store in a file so I could reload it into memory at a later date. Does anyone know how to do this or know of any resources I could check out. Thanks Len If your linked list is flat ( i.e. no sublists ) and each item is of the same type then just output each item in turn in the same sequence that they are in your linked list. If you have sublists then one possibility is to convert the pointers in your list into locations in the file. Generally this means working out where each item will be stored before actually storing any of them. Youll also need a special value for writing out the null pointer , I always use 0 and write a small header at the beginning of the file so that 0 can not be a valid location for a data item. If you list items are of different types then you are into a whole different ball game. John [ about comp.lang.c + + .moderated. First time posters : do this ! ]
