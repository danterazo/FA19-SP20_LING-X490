News Release U.S. Geological Survey October 5 , 1999 When the Shaking Stopped , The Work Began For USGS Scientists Well , it is 3 : 15AM , the shaking stopped a half hour ago , and I still cant get through to any wr.usgs.gov sites. The TV stations are still on the air and none have said anything about it , so I am going back to bed just generally displeased. I believe CalTech shuts down their sites to prevent preliminary info from being given out. Luckily , they forgot to tie down the finger side of the house. : So go to : Incase that one is shut down too , here is the page as of 04 : 31 AM PT.

All times are Greenwich Mean Time. Subtract 8 hours for Pacific Standard time , and 7 hours for Pacific Daylight time. Depths are in km. Entries marked with a " " are PRELIMINARY and have NOT BEEN HUMAN REVIEWED Entries may contain ERRORS and may be UPDATED or DELETED at any time. Entries with origin times within 30 seconds may represent a single event. MAGNITUDE TYPES : MGN = empirically calibrated ML based on readings from high-gain components MLG = ML based on synthetic Wood-Anderson response from low-gain components ML = ML based on synthetic Wood-Anderson response from TerraScope stations ( Q ) - EVENT LOCATION QUALITY The quality of the location is specified by the " Q " designation , with " A " representing the best quality , and " D " representing the worst. ( List is updated when catalog is modified , not at regular intervals ) The SCEC_DC , Caltech , and USGS are members of the Council of the National Seismic System. End
