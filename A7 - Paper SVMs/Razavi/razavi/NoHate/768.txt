here is a process that might help you : Private Sub ListView1_DragDrop ( Source As Control , x As Single , y As Single ) Dim LItem As ListItem from " ListItems " collection in ListView1 If ActiveControl.Name = " name of control you are dragging " Then Set LItem = ListView1.HitTest ( x , y ) this tests to see which area of listview you drop on If LItem Is Nothing Then Exit Sub Debug.print LItem this will show you where you dropped the control . process the item dropped etc. End Sub Allan Ramsay I want to pickup for example a name ( the name must remain visible ( as icon ? ? ) during the dragprocess and put it on another mdi-form. Is this possible in VB6 ? ? Thnx !
