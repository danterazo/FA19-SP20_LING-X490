On Thu , 30 Sep 1999 , Christian Hennecke I installed the X11 version ( from Hobbes ) of GhostScript branching from the root directory of XFree86 ( retaining the paths in the ZIP ) but when I try to open an EPS file , I get the message " Cant find gs_init.ps " . I cant find any references to setup ( expected directories , etc ) and several searches of DEJA didnt bring up anything I could hang my hat on. What is the proper setup for GhostScript under XFree86 ? Is it possible to use a later version of GhostScript ( without compiling the code ) ? Yeah. There is 5.50. In this version you cant use anti-aliasing in X however. Have a look at Christian Hennecke I am aware of the later versions for OS/2 but there is only one designated for X11 on Hobbes. I dont have the tools or the knowledge to compile the source from later versions under XFree86/X11. Are you saying that I can run the OS/2 native code under XFree86 ? Will installing the OS/2 version 5.50 solve the " Cant find the gs_init.ps " file problem ? Best Regards , [ Team OS/2 ] Multitasking at OS/2 Warp4 Speed .
