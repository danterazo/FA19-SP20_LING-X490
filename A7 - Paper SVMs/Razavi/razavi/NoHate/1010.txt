[ please put your reply after what you quote ] Hi group. I am trying to do some research on ley lines and chi energy centering around the hypothesis that both are made up of high frequency/short wavelength electromagnetic radiation. Does anyone think it either is or is not possible for atoms , elements , molecules and compounds to give off such radiation. Thanks for your help. Vern Look at a black body spectrum vs temperature and recant. Do I take it your in the " is not " possible catagory. Is not. Do a search for " ultraviolet catastrophe " to see why.
