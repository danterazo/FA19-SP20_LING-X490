Animator : On my SCT , I first make certain that the finder and scope are aligned. Then I use the dec cricle to get to 90 degrees. Then I rotate the scope in RA while looking through the finder , looking for drift of the center of field of view. If there is , I adjust the dec until this process shows no movement. When there is none , I know the scope is pointed along the RA axis N. Then I use one or more of 4 finder charts that I have printed ( SkyMap ) ) that show Polaris , and I have marked the true NCP on that ( 4 and 7 degree fields , stars to mag 10 and 12 to match sky conditions and the finders capabilites ) . Holding the chart so it is oriented similarly to the finders field of view , I use the wedges adjustments to move the whole scope assembly to the area where the NCP is. For finer adjustments , i then use star drift ( which , after this process , can leave me waiting a long time to see drift ) . Dale .
