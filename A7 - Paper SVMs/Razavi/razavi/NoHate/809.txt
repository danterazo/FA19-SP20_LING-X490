Geez , this is a long thread. but I would like to add my $ 0.02 also. Greg , you didnt really give enough information regarding the condition of the rim and the alleged defect. I would be wary of riding a wheel that took 3 hours to build because of this problem. Your LBS should have caught this before building the wheel. Kevin is a good person. I have had several dealings with him and all went very well. He is honest and very considerate. Like many others who have spoken before me , I would not hesitate to do business with Kevin again. Sometimes peoples true intent isnt well communicated by email - one of the problems with this wonderful and still relatively new technology. Hopefully , what you thought was " smug and arrogant " was just unfortunate miscommunication. BTW , if you dont think Kevins prices are reasonable , you have the option not to buy from him. it is not fair to complain about this part of the deal when you bought the rim anyway. Stuart Winsor We all should be wary of exploiting a good persons name to so many people , for unworthy reasons. I have had nothing but good dealings with Kevin. Besides , he is part of the RBM family and people will back him up all day. Out of over 65 shops in the Twin Cities , I know of less than ten that can build good wheels , Kev builds all the time and I bet he has built some of these rims quite nicely. Even if the rim was bad , this issue should be addressed between buyers. Make it public when you truly get scammed , Michal Knudsen Before you buy .
