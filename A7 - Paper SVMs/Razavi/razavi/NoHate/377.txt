On Sat , 25 Sep 1999 GMT , " Keith Blakemore-Noble " something about " Re : AMozilla ? Whats happening ? " . Uhhhexactly what is it that you can do on your PC that you can not do on your Amiga ? For me , WYSIWYG web development. ahem Erm , Gary , there is no such thing as WYSIWYG web page development. It is physically impossible. Of course , I know you meant " graphical web page creation " , but I just thought I would point out that WYSIWYG HTML does not exist , nor has it ever existed : ) BTW , let us not forget the range of web page creation software which already exists on the Amiga. The Built With Amiga Software site has pointers to a variety of such tools from several authors ( hey , you knew I left that open for you my friend. : ) Hoping you would take the ball and run . Mind you , personally I just use GoldEd and hsc - a more powerful combination for website creation I have yet to find on any platform , in all honesty ! : ) Good combo , but then start making interactive sites with hundreds of pages. Knowing that you can cut and paste , throw templates across multiple pages in one pass , support nested tables and layers properly , etc makes a growing site like Owlnet turn from an abomination to do into something much easier. I agree that smaller sites with less than 15 pages are fun to code by hand , but add another 100 plus pages to that with limited time to get them all out and you can see my frustration. Dream Weaver , for instance , can take a template site wide in about 1 minutes with a large site , almost as a batch process. Now do that by hand to change one silly thing " like copyright 1998-1999 " to " copyright 1998-2000 " and do it over 150-200 pages. : ( Gary Peake , TAC-OwlNet.Net Team AMIGA Central We provide free web sites for small developers Sometimes you are the windshield , sometimes you are the bug !
