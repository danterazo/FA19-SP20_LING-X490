[ Subject of desktops on small systems ] Photon has a window manager and a desktop manager , and I was most certainly including them , when I made the above statement. How does the environment compare to the one presented by KDE in terms of whats provided ? I cant really tell that much about the environment from QNXs screen shots. there is enough in standard QNX to use Photon for all normal activities. You get a shell ( command line ) Help viewer File manager Network Note mechanism CD player Diary / Day scheduler A simple calculator A simple graphic viewer Screen dump utility Jump gate ( for moving running applications from one node to another ) sytems tools ( sin , sac , font , print ) and some demos and games. And , unlike Be , QNX at least has a foothold somewhere. QNX is rated number two embedded OS in shipped numbers behind WinCE in that marketplace. IMHO it is number one on merit - it is cheaper , and better. regards John B .
