Hmmm. I just happened to notice this and put it together with a few other items about ICR people : Have you noticed that technically trained creationists are almost always engineers rather than scientists ? I know that engineers have to master maths and some physics ( enough to design a car or build a bridge that doesnt fall down ) , but apparently they are not always taught to think critically. Some years ago I discovered that an aerospace engineer of my acquaintance was a firm believer in the theories of Velikovsky. No , I agree-dont underestimate them. Mike Dworetsky PEM Well , what do you expect from people who are just not that smart ? PEM I would be willing to wager that none of them have ever looked PEM through a telescope or read any books on Astronomy. If they PEM really had done either , they would have some doubts. The Washington Post had a front page article recently on a Kansas couple. He was an engineer with a couple of degrees , she was a school teacher ; both were devout creationists. Creationists may not be critical thinkers , but dont underestimate them .
