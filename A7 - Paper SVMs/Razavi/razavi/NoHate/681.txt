I am talking about chemicals that NO ONE has ever eaten. My body has an evolutionary history & can handle anything that humans & most of their ancestors ate in the past , but not some chemicals that never existed before. But thats _why_ you should support genetically modified food crops. When a chemist creates a new synthetic insecticide , _thats_ a chemical your body has never seen before. When a biologist splices a gene from a flounder into a tomato plant ( which has been done to improve frost resistance ) , that is just rearranging existing natural chemicals. What concerned me about re-engineeering a species of blue-green algae is the possibilty it could escape and begin reproducing on its own. Once released , there is no way we could call it back. Worse , this particular example of re-engineered algae has a potent insecticide in it , which could upset the ecosystem at a very fundamental level .
