Even so , there were thousands of PPC accelerators sold ( I cant remember how many ) so 200 pre-payments is a pretty poor show. Microcode Solutions could have made much more money by ditching the Amiga and going over to the PC. They must be considering it now given the apparent lack of interest in Amiga FusionPPC and PCxPPC. They have to get their beer money from somewhere ! Thats not an apparent lack of interest. If a software company asked PC users to pay for software which had not yet been written , on a promise that it would be released by a particular date , I doubt they would get many takers. Also , PC users dont face as many vapor products as Amiga users. I think some of us have gotten a little jaded with so many raised hopes and undelivered products. But I am not saying that applies to FusionPPC. The fact is I dont know. The atmosphere of vapor products has trickled all the way to the top of the food chain at AI/Gateway. It makes it very difficult to convince the majority of PPC / Amiga owners ( including me ) to risk the money in this situation. Desperation should not force us to pay for software which we have no way of knowing if it will be any good. I am sure that if FusionPPC is released at a reasonable price , and proves to be a good product , it will sell well. But until it is released , you really cant complain about Amiga users not supporting it. Once Microcode release FusionPPC and proves it is not just another good intention , more Amiga owners will buy. But what will really turn things around is hearing how good it works and all the popular PowerMac software titles that current owners are running. After all , thats why people buy things. People are more apt to purchase an actual working product than a good intention. Especially with the roller coaster ride the remaining Amiga owners have had to endure.joe
