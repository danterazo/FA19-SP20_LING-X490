So this Spudman character tells us. # # the header. They also include you IP address in all e-mails as well. I should hope so , most SMTP servers do. I have personally never seen an e- mail without an originating host IP address in the header. Then you havent looked at lots of headers. Common sendmail.cf files now put the originating hosts IP address in the Received line , but this has only been common for a few years , and many sites are still running old sendmails or new sendmails with old configuration files. I dont recall if it is actually in any of the RFCs or not , but if it is not , it should be. The SMTP RFC only requires the receiving MTA to include the name specified in the HELO command in the " from " clause of the " Received : " header ; this name may have no relationship to the actual sending machines address ( all that is required is that it have proper domain syntax ) . Modern MTAs include the correspondent IP address and the domain name from its reverse lookup in a comment in the Received line , i.e. Received : from HELO-name ( reverse-lookup-name [ ip-address ] ) . but the comment is not required by any specification.
