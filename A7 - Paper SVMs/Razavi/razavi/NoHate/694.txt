I am more the active type myself. One of the things I learned in school was how to sleep with my eyes open , but I cant do it in seiza without falling over. ( I have tried a few times very embarrassing to keel over in the middle of a lecture. I didnt really wake up until I hit the ground too. It was neither graceful nor martial according to eye-witness reports. ) heheeh , funny stuff. during our gasshuku I had a friend sitting next to me doing the same thing. Luckily for him I would hit him with a fairly consitant round of rib-pokes to keep him awake. It didnt help much when he started snoring though. Before you buy .
