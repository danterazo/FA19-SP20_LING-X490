Me , I got destiller from adobe , and create a pdf-file from the postscript- [ . ] Is destiller free ? /j I really do not know. I upgraded my PageMaker just to get it : it was cheaper than to get Acrobat. Anyway , it is annoying to have to rebbot to Win95 , but I only work there fore the 30 seconds it takes to creat a 200 pages pdf-file. One reasonable idea is to send a postscriptfile to someone who has destiller , and he can easily do it. I would be happy to help out. / Jan
