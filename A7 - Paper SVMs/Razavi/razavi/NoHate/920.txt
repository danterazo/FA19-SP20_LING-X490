But do you actually SEE more detail at magnifications beyond the 50x or so ( 80x for high quality refractors and long focal length high quality reflectors ) ? I know the conventional wisdom says , " No " , and in this case I am included to agree , based on views through a high quality 6 inch refractor and VERY steady seeing conditions. Forgive the repeat posting , but I have an analogy to describe the overmagnification paradox , for anyone who may not have dealt with it : it is like walking into a movie theatre and sitting in the back row. The picture looks fine , but the image is a bit small. So you move up to the center of the auditorium. Picture still looks fine , but you can actually see more detail. People and objects on the screen are bigger and you feel more a part of things. Then you think if moving up a little made it better , then moving up a lot will be great ! So you go sit in the front row. Blech ! Now you are so close that you see the film grain. Contrast is very poor , you can actually see the texture on the screen surface and now everything looks kind of soft ! Youve officially passed the limits of image magnification for that setup. So move back a few rows to get a better compromise , say oh.50x-60x per inch of scope diameter !
