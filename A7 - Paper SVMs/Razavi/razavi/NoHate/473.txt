It was previously posted that the Velodrome swapmeet is October 23rd. I havent heard of any change in that date. It just happened a few weeks ago ! At least it was posted that way ? Does anyone know when the swap meet is going to be at the Velodrome in San Diego ? Thanks. Steve Fredericks Oceanside , CA
