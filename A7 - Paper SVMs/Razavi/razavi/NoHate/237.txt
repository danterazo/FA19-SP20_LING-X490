Thank you very much for your suggestion. I have checked my firmware version and found it is 1.21. I have checked also some films scanned some days before but can not find the trace of scratch. What I recognized the difference was that I used single scan for every pictures on a strip of 4 to 6. The scratch happened when I have used batch scan mode with direct saving to disk. Will it be the safety way for using the SA-20 by setting to single scanning mode ? Thanks you again for your kindly help I load my negs in the strip holder. Yes it will scratch. Neg film is a lot softer than slide film. Also the settings stay the same and do not default each neg scanned. Check which Firmware you have in the scanner ( 1.21 Thats the number that shows along the top when you open up the Nikon scan programme ) solves some of the early problems. Rm I have a new LS-2000 scanner which I have bought for couple of weeks. Yesterday I scanned my negative with the " ICE " turned off , I found all photos get one or two straight lines along the direction of film feeding besides the white dots of dust. I checked the film under strong light and believed the film surface has been scarched after passing through the SA-20 strip film feeder. I opened the SA-20 and found the scarch lines matched 2 of the plastic guiding webs at the rear inner compartment. I want to ask : 1 ) Anyone get the same problem ? 2 ) Is it caused by curved film strip ? 3 ) Shall I take the machine to service ? 4 ) How to avoid ? Thanks all !
