Does anyone run IBM OS2 Warp and an Amiga System ? I use Amigas at home for regular work ( programming , internet ) and an OS/2 notebook when I am travelling. I did at one time. IBM stopped developing OS/2. This is not true. They no longer fight Windoze on the desktop. Once I realized that fact , I abandoned OS/2 , and moved on to Linux. There is an effort to convince IBM to open-source OS/2. No way. They earn money with it .
