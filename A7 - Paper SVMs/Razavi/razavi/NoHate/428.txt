My CD-ROM drive gives me the message that it is not accessible the door on the drive will not open. When I boot up , the light on the drive door do not flash. Operating Win 98. HELP ! " The CyberCitizen " Before you buy. 1. Check the bios setting to see if there is a cdrom setting , or auto. Make sure it is set to either cdrom or auto for the proper device. 2. Check the power cable going to the CD Rom Drive. It only plugs in one way. 3. Check the IDE cable , is it plugged in ? Is the stripe on the cable on pin one ? 4. Check to make sure the slave and master is set correctly on the cdrom and any other device on that cable. Hope this helps. Chris Posted via CNET Help.com
