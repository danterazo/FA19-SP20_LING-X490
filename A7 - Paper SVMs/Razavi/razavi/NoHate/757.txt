Hi all , I have a P120 laptop running 3.11 which I would like to upgrade to Win.98. It has an internal floppy drive but no CD-ROM , I dont have an external CD-ROM to plug in. I know it is possible to get 98 on floppy but I dont fancy feeding 50-odd disks ( or whatever ) . I do have a network card with which I can connect the laptop to our LAN and access a shared CD-ROM , but presumably the 98 upgrade process involves rebooting etc. which would loose the connection. Any way out other than 98 on floppy ? Help appreciated. Regards , Mark Graves
