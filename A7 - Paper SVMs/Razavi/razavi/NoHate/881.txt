Dear Chris I just saw this ! I am actualy living in Camden , and also looking for the same. I know you by good reputation and your stickers on Otaris ! Please let me know of any control room and live area spaces in North London for rent. Ps. I fancy an MX 80 as a aperatif to my Pro Tools rig ! , how much should I expect to pay ? All the best Julian Standen P.S/. I am desperate to find a place . thanks ! I know just the pace for you. How does Camden suit ? It is a trendy/bohemian area about 4 miles north of Oxford Circus. They currently have a DDA AMR/MTR90 set up but are moving out now. Email for further details Pip pip Chris Notton } //// (
