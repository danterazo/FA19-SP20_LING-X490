there was a big discussion particular to the program which you speak of ( Britannica ) , search deja news for it , sorry I am not familiar enought to recap it for you. Daniel Pat Pridgen schrieb : I was going to Install my Britannica CD in OS/2 , and then it wanted to install Win32s into WinOS/2. Is this going to be a problem ? I dont want to mess up a perfectly fine setup by doing this. I bought this when I had Windows , and would still like to be able to use it. Well , it depends on the version of Win32s the program needs. OS/2 officially supports only up to version 1.25a and definitely wont work with a _real_ 1.30. If this app installs 1.30 then you can try to backup your WIN32S.INI and install 1.25a over 1.30 so you get 1.25a with the needed additional 1.30 files. Sometimes you have to change the WIN32S.INI file since some programs check the version number. A lot of apps install 1.30 , but do run with this " hybrid " . You may also have to tweak your Win-OS/2 settings. There are some hints in the OS/2 README file or the AskPSP from the Bonuspak. Sounds quite complicated , eh ? But I can assure you that a lot of Win32s programs will work this way. They did here. Christian Hennecke Keep passing the open windows ! ( " The Hotel New Hampshire " , John Irving )
