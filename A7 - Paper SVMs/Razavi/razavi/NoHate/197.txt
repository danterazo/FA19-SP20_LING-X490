The other Warren is pretty much right. Copy over the WIN98 directory from the shared CD to some nice spot on your hard drive. Then run the setup from that new directory. Mine takes up about 170 MB and is worth keeping around , but then I have a big drive. You could delete that directory afterwards setup , but you would often be scounging this or that CAB file from the network when you make changes. I wouldnt worry about the registry having the old entries. I sometimes go change mine so it refers to my online files instead of the CD , but the several locations are often there in a drop down menu or recently used locations. Warren S. Hello , IF you have the room on your hard drive you could copy the CD onto it , then boot from floppy to go. The only problem : you would most likely want the disk space back , and Windows will try to refer to that drive every time you install hardware ( or software requiring support ) . I know it is possible to edit the registry to get rid of the annoyance , but I am too chicken to try ( and cant remember exactly how ) . I have done it for a number of installs , and it is the fastest way to install as well. good luck ! Warren Hi all , I have a P120 laptop running 3.11 which I would like to upgrade to Win.98. It has an internal floppy drive but no CD-ROM , I dont have an external CD-ROM to plug in. I know it is possible to get 98 on floppy but I dont fancy feeding 50-odd disks ( or whatever ) . I do have a network card with which I can connect the laptop to our LAN and access a shared CD-ROM , but presumably the 98 upgrade process involves rebooting etc. which would loose the connection. Any way out other than 98 on floppy ? Help appreciated. Regards , Mark Graves Before you buy .
