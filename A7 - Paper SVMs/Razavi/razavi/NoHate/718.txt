How lucky I am ! Today in my mailbox I recieved this song ! Imagine ! [ musical spam snipped ] No matter how many times I sang that letter , I couldnt NOT sing it to the tune of " Oh , Canada. " Of course , my brane is now tainted. I finally got a chance to listen to the Spy Fox theme song. Nothing I ever hear from this day forth will ever measure up. Thats because " O Canada " has no tune of its own. It is the only existing parasitic national anthem. It commonly steals the tune from " O Christmas Tree " , and occasionally from " Copacabana " . HTH .
