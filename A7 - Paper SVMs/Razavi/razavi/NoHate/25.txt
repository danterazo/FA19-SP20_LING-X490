Yes , the image was larger , but I could not see more details. So I conclude that you can save your money on short focal length eyepieces and just learn to see more details at lower mags. Hi David : It depends on the scope , it is collimation , the observer , the eyepieces , and , most importantly , the seeing. I can tell you that I have continued to see more detail at powers of up to ( and over ) 600x on my 8 inch SCT on those really good nights. But down here on the Gulf Coast we often have superbly steadyif hazyskies.
