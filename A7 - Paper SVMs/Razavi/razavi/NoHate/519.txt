if you really never want to let the user to leave the textbox , try : sub text1_lostfocus ( ) text1.setfocus end sub If you want to make it conditional : sub text1_lostfocus ( ) if mycondition = true then text1.setfocus end sub Good Luck Is there a way to have a control ( TextBox ) that keep the focus on the form even if I click on other controls on the form ? For example , a TextBox that represent a number and all other controls refers to that number , I would need to keep the focus on the TextBox until something is written in it. Etienne Charland
