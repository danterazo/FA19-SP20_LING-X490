Thoughts at random : Given the need to fill the frame with 35mm , I would never buy a camera for which I couldnt afford to purchase multiple lenses in a reasonable period of time. The difference between Nikons best lenses and the Leitz lenses is going to be negligible in the real world. Most folks buy Leica because they want , and can afford Leica , not because Leica is the best out there. Paul I am about to plunk down 3 grand on a new camera and I am trying to get the best possible camera/lens I can afford. I am looking for all the help I can get. I am thinking about the Leica R8 , Contax RTSiii , Contax AX , or the Nikon F5. I currently use a Nikon FA. I started on this kick wanting an auto-focus , but then I thought I should concentrate on getting great lenses. After going around in circles for a few weeks I need some serious help. These are the important points as I see them. Leica has great lenses and a body that is easy to operate , but I wish it had an integral winder with auto-bracketing. Contax also has great lenses , but I am not sure if the bodies are as capable and as easy to use as the R8. Also , I can get a great deal on these ( NOT mail order ) so I can afford more than the one lens I can get with the Leica. Nikon has a great body and I could get a lot more lenses for the money. But is it to complicated ? Are the Leica and Zeiss lenses really that much better ? And are they really worth so much more money ? Thank you for your assistance and your expertise. Lou Goldring
