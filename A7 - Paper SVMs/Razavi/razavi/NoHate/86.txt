Whats really needed is tri-state logic : X .EQ. Y , X .NE. Y , X .UNORDERED. Y Arent there intrinsics for that - such as ISNAN , ISFINITE , and company ? As soon as the standardization process completes for ISO/IEC TR 15580 , you should be able , if your compiler vendor is kind enough to implement it , and if your hardware supports IEEE arithmetic , to do something like : USE IEEE_ARITHMETIC IF ( IEEE_UNORDERED ( X , Y ) ) THEN . Ah , but thats not what I meant. I mean something like IF ( X .GT. Y ) 100 , 200 , 300 depending on whether X .GT. Y is .TRUE. , .FALSE. or .UNORDERED. ( I agree I was talking about tri-state logic , not whether you could determine that X is unordered w.r.t. Y .
