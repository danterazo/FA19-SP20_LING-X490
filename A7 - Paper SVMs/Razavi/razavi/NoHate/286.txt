Sorry , Pierre this isnt necessarily directed at you , and I know it isnt directly helpful. But why on earth do so many people insist on applying operating system upgrades without making backups ? Because it was my distinct impression that the upgrade did a backup before anything else ! Thats what I wanted to back out with , but I can see no way of doing so without Web access ( I did once back out using the rsu method , but I cant see how to do it without a full graphical system able to run Netscape. ) I did buy a CDRW to make backups , but I got it only on Friday , and I havent yet figured out how to use it. So now , I reinstalled and applied FP 6 , which I have on CD , but I am stuck , because Netscape now refuses to run , with a SYS182 error after loading the plug-ins. Does the Explorer still work with the latest rsu updates so I can go back to 11 ? Pierre Pierre Jelenc | The Cucumbers " Total Vegetility " is out ! | Pawnshops " Three Brass Balls " is out !
