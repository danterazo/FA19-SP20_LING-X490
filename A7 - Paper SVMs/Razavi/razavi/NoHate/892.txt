Consider some politically loaded issue , say free trade. Suppose 95 % of economistsdefined , for the moment , by conventional credentialssupport free trade ( which is probably roughly true ) . Um ? I assume youd include all the economists in various foreign countries who consider fair trade to be a bad thing ? Assuming you mean " free trade " . . 1. I think the study was limited to economists in the U.S. 2. We have to distinguish between what people believe and what they saysome government employees ( or corporate employees , for that matter ) are saying what their employers want to say , not what they believe. It is widely believed in the profession that Fords very distinguished chief economist ceased to be their chief economist because he was unwilling to argue for auto tariffs. 3. We also have the problem of defining " economist " the problem I was suggesting when I pointed out that there were creationists who , in terms of academic credentials , qualified as biologists. It doesnt follow that there is serious controversy within biology over creation vs evolution. There are lots of people who would describe themselves as economists who I wouldnt describe as real economists , and who I suspect Paul Krugman , whose politics are rather different from mine , wouldnt describe as real economists either. The reason is not that they disagree with meEarl Thompson and Abba Lerner disagreed with me , and certainly were ( in Earls case , still is ) economists. The reason is that they either could not get a reasonably good grade on a price theory exami.e. do not understand the fundamentals of economic theoryor could get it only by giving answers they didnt believei.e. dont agree with the fundamentals of economic theory. They are " economists " in the sense of " people who are hired to do things that economists are expected to do , " such as predict demand for their employers products. David Friedman
