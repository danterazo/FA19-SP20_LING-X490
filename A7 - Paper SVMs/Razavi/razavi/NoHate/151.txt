try reformatting the drive I have been trying to install windows on a friends machine , it had an old noisy hard disk in it and apparently crashed during normal use. It then wouldnt reboot to windows and said there was a system disk failure where it usually says starting windows 9x. anyway i replaced the hard disk and now it wont get past a certain point in the windows installation , i know the hard disk is ok now ( and has worked with this mobo/processor before ) so it cant be that. the point it reaches ( I have tried it with win 98 and win 95 ) is when they first load the setup files and the bar reaches 100 % , and it then tries to go to the next dialog , it gets as far as drawing part of a black box on screen and then freezes , and i have to reset. I am thinking theres some sort of test the windows install wants to do at that point and there is something very obviously wrong ! i have no idea what to do right now and any help would be much appreciated. thanks.
