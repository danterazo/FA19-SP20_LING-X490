As information for others like me who may be in the dark about this subject , here is what worked for me. I copied gzip.exe as gunzip.exe. I opened up the gunzip.exe property notebook and added -d to the parameters line. Now there is no need to use a OS/2 command window - just drag and drop the .gz file onto the gunzip.exe icon and voila. Actually , there is no need to make that extra copy of gzip. Just create a program object pointing to gzip.exe , with " -d " in the parameters field and it will work just fine. You can have other program objects pointing to gzip.exe with other parameters ( or no parameters ) if you wish .
