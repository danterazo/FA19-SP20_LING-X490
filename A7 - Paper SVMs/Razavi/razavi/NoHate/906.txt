Can anyone tell me where to sell my gear besides eBay and A.SOUP You can try Yahoo , it is free , but dont expect too much. If you are selling , there is no place like eBay , thats where all the suckers hang out. I see used gear sold for more than the new price all the time. Example : Used Roland XP-10 sold at eBay for $ 600 ( it is widely available in stores for $ 499 or less ) another good one : Old Alesis QuadraSynth sold at eBay for $ 900 ! ( real market value $ 400 ) eBay has all the traffic , and it is a sellers market , If you are buying , look for classified ads and newsgroups like this one. Les
