I thought heat was caused by over-stimulated molecules. Heat is energy. Energy can be released by a variety of things. No molecules , no heat. There is a classic demonstration concerning heat : two magnifying mirrors are arranged so that light from the focus of one mirror bounces off the mirror , travels through a distance to the other mirror , and is refocussed at the focal point of the second mirror. This arrangement is called a Schlieren system , and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror , and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the " heat " radiation that is gathered by one mirror , passed through the glass , and refocussed by the second mirror. Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux ? Not directly. It can disturb atoms or molecules that are ferromagnetic , randomizing the orientations of their permanent magnetic moments ( their internal bar magnets ) . Tom Davidson Aurora , CO
