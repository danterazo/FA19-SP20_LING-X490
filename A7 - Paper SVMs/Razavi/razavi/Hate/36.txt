What do you prefer 1 ton of ice coming on your building at 100m/s or 1M , 1gr pieces at the same velocity , but seperately ? [ Forgot the correct name for such ice fragments in english ] The same will be for 1Ton bomb vs 1M , 1gr TNT fragments. What do you think will do more damage in a city ? A single 100 Ton bomb or thousand 100 kg bombs , scattered across the city ? It is the second , not the first. Mati Meron | " When you argue with a fool , chances are he is doing just the same "
