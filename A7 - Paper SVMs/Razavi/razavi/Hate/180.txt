Hell , even at 2 : 00 pm I dont do proofs. In fact , real men and scientists never do proofs. Proofs are done only by math weenies , course instructuctors trying to fill the required time , and students who are having their noses rubbed in it. Physicists dont need no steenking proofs ! God , I hope this is being posted to sci.physics or I am in big trouble ! ) I do not agree. Real men dont do _rigorous_ proofs. They do , however , have enormous turgid intuitions , which enable them to sense within a 99.9 % confidence level if a theorem is true without doing no stinking _rigorous_ proof. : Ah , so that explains it : . /BAH Subtract a hundred and four for e-mail .
