To the uncivilized Greek Government : Since the Greek occupation of Aegean Macedonia , by changing my first and last name from Macedonian into Greek does not make me Greek. You occupied my land. Who gave you the right to change the toponyms and our first and last names , suppressing the Macedonian language , erasing the Macedonian script in the churches and rewriting over with Greek. That tells me that you are still an uncivilized country. You have to admit that in Greece there are 7 other nationalities living there. They all need human rights. Where is your democracy , on paper only ? Ilinden Subject : Re : Who are the Ftcogians The Greeks are humiliating themselves all over the world. There are Greek organizations that visit sick people in hospitals. They think that anyone with a Greek last name is automatically Greek. But this is not true because the Greek government changed the names of the Macedonians living in Aegean Macedonia into Greek in 1926. That is why it was embarassing for the Greeks when they came to visit my aunt in the hospital. She does not speak Greek but her name was changed into Greek against her will. Ilinden Where did they meet your aunt ? In a hospital or . ? Does she have a name or she is no-name as your irrefurable evidence ? Are you brain-damaged or not ? Are you taking drugs or not ? Are you racist or not ? Have you realised that you talk the same language with all the Slavs or not ? Some questions you have to answer to yourself first ! lol oh man ! He has repeated this story a thousand time here ! Others have asked him the same thing and you never get a straight response ! Very noble try never the less ! Come on Ilinden make up some more bull shit ! Or pull an article from some half baked writer that goes with the same party line as you ! Your so full of shit ilinden I can smell you all the way over here ! LOL Same old ilinden beating the hell out of the same old drum !
