I have always known that all receivers have local oscillator content but depending on how well they are shielded , the RF emissions are anywhere from a few feet to a pretty lengthy path. At least , thats always been my assumption just from playing around with alot of radios over the years. CHECK THIS WEB PAGE OUT.mobiltrak.com/wecome_1.htm Can anyone shed some light on how they are doing this ? it is very interesting. Before you buy. A little followup : HMMMM. I sure as hell would like to see one of these " sensors " . As someone who spent 15 years in Radio , I do know Radio GMs will buy anything from someone who can mimic their OWN sales ability. " Birds of a feather , you know " . or how about , " Bullshitting a bullshitter " Before you buy .
