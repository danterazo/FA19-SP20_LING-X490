Dr. Lipstadt has never " denied " the murders of Soviet citizens by their own government. Keep lying , Pohl. JGB She denies that there were any murdered on the basis of ethnicity. According to her they were all random and arbitrary. I am obviously not lying since I am quoting her own words. She does this because in her mind murders based on ethnicity are morally worse than murders committed for other reasons including random and arbitrary quotas. This itself is a very dubious moral postion. In order to make the Shoa appear morally worse under these conditions it is necessary for her to deny the ethnic component of Stalins murders. The Soviet documentation on the deportations is quite clear that the deportations were undertaken solely for ethnic reasons , not political reasons , not randomly , not arbitrarly and not for military necessity. Stalin deported Soviet Germans , Chechens , Crimean Tatars , Meskhetian Turks etc. to special settlements for the same reason Hitler killed Jews , they were of the wrong ethnicity. J.
