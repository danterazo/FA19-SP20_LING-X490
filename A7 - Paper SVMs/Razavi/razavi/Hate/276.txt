It sounds as though you are arguing that the supply is very inelastic wrt price. Why would you expect that to be true ? Gold mining is a very expensive operation , and how deep it is worth going , how low a grade of ore it is worth processing , etc. depend on the price. Because almost all the gold dug up the past 5000 years is still above ground and part of the current " supply " . The amount of new gold mined every year barely increases the total. The size of the world economy has something like doubled in the past decade or two. But the gold amount in circulation hasnt. But if the econonmy grows faster than the amount of money in circulation , you get deflation. And contrary to what monetarists and gold bugs say , deflation is bad. 5 % inflation are a nuisance , but 5 % deflation means that the economy is in deep shit. Run that by me again. If suddenly everybody is rich , this is a bad thing ? Okay , granted , it cant last , but in the meantime it is all good. So please tell me why deflation is a bad thing. Deflation leads to money hoarding , which draws more money from the market , leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible , buying only the baremost necessities , and this as late as he can. The result is , of course , collapse. Talk me through this , okay ? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5 % more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5 % more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing ? No , my friend , if you truly think that , then you are obviously no student of human nature. Your argument against deflation is that " it leads to money hoarding. " This is patently untrue , thus your argument has no base. Unless I am missing something. ?
