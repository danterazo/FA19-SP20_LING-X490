Someone in this newsgroup was wondering what was meant by Micro vs. Macro evolution. Micro evolution is when a creature adapts to it is envionment genetically. This happens all the time. We have definate proof for it. Anyone denying it is a moron. Macro evolution is when a creature ceases to be able to breed with similar creatures and so becomes a separate creature. Macro Evolution is decried as false and unscientific by protestant evangelists. Unfortunetly , the strength of their protests reduces their credibility. Come on , arent they the ones who proposed that man was made from dust ? Frank Bartunek
