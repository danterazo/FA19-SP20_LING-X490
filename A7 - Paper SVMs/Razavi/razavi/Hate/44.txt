Well , what do you expect from people who are just not that smart ? I would be willing to wager that none of them have ever looked through a telescope or read any books on Astronomy. If they really had done either , they would have some doubts. Funny thing is that the Universe that God made is a lot bigger and more complex.than these poor folks can imagine ! Ed Murray
