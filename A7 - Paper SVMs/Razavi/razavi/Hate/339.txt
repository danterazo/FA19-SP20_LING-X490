I have heard Bells is good. I havent tried it yet myself. Perhaps I should. Right now im drinking a Summit Alt Bier. Its okay. All this fancy beer talk isnt very punk rock is it ? perhaps I should put my two cents in about Blatz. Blatz is good beer. I like Blatz a lot , and Pabst. there we go. thats better. Topher Fuck thatdrinking good beer is punk as hell. Nobody said it was punk to have bad taste. Beer , meat and green chile are the 3 things I enjoy most in the world of food and drink. I will spend large amounts of money on these things as they keep me happy. Just remembered.I DO like an ale really well too. Called Fat Tire. it is brewed up in denver and therefore I can get it fairly cheap down here. Woowoo Zac
