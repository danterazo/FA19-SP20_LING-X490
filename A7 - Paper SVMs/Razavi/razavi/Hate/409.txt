Do you honestly think that computers do arithmetic ? I have yet to find a spell checker that knows what I am talking about when I write. And what about the spell checker that likes to sprinkle nots all over the place. Computers do not do it better ; they may do it faster. One of the primary conditions that usually goes into machine design is that better is a function of faster. Snort. Silly man. /BAH Subtract a hundred and four for e-mail .
