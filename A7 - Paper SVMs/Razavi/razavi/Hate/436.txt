But , not to put a fine point on it , you belong to a religion that I would say has a racist background. Good grief ! Now I am a " racist " too , as well as an " ass " and a " crackpot " ! Would you mind pointing out exactly the " racist " aspects of my religious beliefs ? I am really eager to discover them ! I guess Doug isnt talking about the asinine , easily-disproved beliefs about what happened in the Americas ca. 2kya. And what beliefs are these exactly ? So maybe it is the bit about a dark skin being a sign of Gods disfavour ? Who believes this exactly ? See , it gets tougher when you deal with real people instead of ill-informed stereotypes. R. Ben Madison
