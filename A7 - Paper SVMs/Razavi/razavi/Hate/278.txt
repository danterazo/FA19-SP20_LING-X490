It is possible that the board and other parts will say " Uniden " . A TRC-465 ( PC-122 clone ) has " Uniden " clearly etched on the PC board. hello readers , i was wondering how you tell if a Cobra 148GTL was made by uniden or not ? i have an older 148 and would really like to know who really made it. and is there a way to get about 8-10 watts deadkey out of one of these things ( and who can do it and make it sound better/clearer ) it allready has the extra chans ( never use them , never will ) and 1 more thing , can anything be done to filter the incoming signals more ? the anl/nb does not do much on my 148. thanks all. remove " -NOSPAM- " to reply by e-mail posts to the newsgroup do NOT need e-mailing Unit SIX-NINE Chesapeake Bay aka Weed Whacker Mobile | SAVE BANDWIDTH !
