Hi [ SNIP ] Just think how much less bandwidth Tim would create if people didnt reply to him. Now might be a time to look up on how to set up killfiles in your newsreader. or how to use private replies. Regards Tom If 7-11 is open 24 hours a day , 365 days a year , why are there locks on the doors ?
