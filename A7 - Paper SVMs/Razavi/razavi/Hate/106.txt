Thanks for the information. Your sniffing faq answered a lot of fundamental questions I had. To follow up : It appears that you are indeed receiving the initial SYN packet , but that your machine isnt responding with a SYN ACK. This indicates some firewalling going on at the machine itself. However , when I telnet to port 25 from behind the firewall my machine does respond. It is only when I telnet to port 25 from outside the firewall that it doest respond. Is there a reason why my machine would respond to a request from inside the firewall , but not to a request from outside the firewall ? And only do so for port 25 ( port 23 and 110 work fine ) ? thanks. p.s. I am running RedHat Linux 6.0 Is your firewall set to allow traffic through port 25 from the outside ? Most of the firewall setups for home networks are set up to allow unlimited traffic from within the private network , but block traffic from outside except at specified ports. If you only have port 25 set to allow outgoing traffic and incoming traffic with an ack bit , then you need to open port 25 to all traffic , but if you do that make sure your smtp/sendmail is configured to only allow relaying from inside the firewall or from priveledged IPs outside or you will become a spam relay.
