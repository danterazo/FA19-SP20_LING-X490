I was vacationing in Canada when this occurred. Canada has a type of socialist health care system in which drugs are not a covered option. The Govt controls the pricing to their standards. A group of older people bought anti-cancer drugs ( toxinol ? ? ? something like that , spelling sucks but it is manufactured from pine tree bark I understand ) nsaids and other pain meds , including narcotics. They were was extensively covered by the Canadian press. They paid from 200 to 1000 % ! less than across the border. It is the American pharmaceutical companies who develop and market to Americans to which they markup their R/D costs to , the rest of the world gets it at its fair price ! Does anyone see something wrong here ? BETYOURBOTTOM , LTD .
