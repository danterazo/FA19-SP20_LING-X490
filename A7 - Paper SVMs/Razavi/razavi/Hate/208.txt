Pete McCutchen said : Feudalist said : properties to begin with and those who had the savvy to invest on growth stocks. The losers are middle class and lower classes. Few people now call household with an annual income of $ 100,000 middle class. Even folks Bullshit. Mutual funds , 401 ( k ) plans , and ETrade bring those afforementioned growth stocks within range of the middle and lower classes. Yes. If anything , stock and other financial paper ownership has widened tremendously over the last decade or two. Increasingly , the line between the upper and middle classes is blurring beyond all hope of reconstruction. Instead of seperate " classes " , there is now a smooth continuum of wealth. who gets $ 80,000/year income are one or two paychecks away from the streets. Only if they spend too much money. Feudalist seems not to realize that someone making $ 80,000 a year who gets fired does not continue spending his money at the same rate ; he cuts back on expenditures until he has found another high-paying job. ( To be fair , the alarmists who spread the " one or two paychecks from the streets " stories also made this assumption. They did so because they wanted to make people believe that they were in risk of becoming bums ) .
