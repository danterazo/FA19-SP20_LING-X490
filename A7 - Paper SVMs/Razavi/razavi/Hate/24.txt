why was domain alias given for the LANL Eprint archive ? I noticed both these DNS entries map to the same IP address. The address seems to take longer to connect than the direct. hmm ? also why didnt they make it the capital X is awkward when typing fast hehe. Domain names are not case sensitive. You can type a lowercase if you want. I suppose they couldnt make it or it would get wasted traffic from porno seekers ! eek. I suspect one reason why there is an arxiv.org is because some of those wonderful net censorship programs ( " protect the children " , you know ) are stupid enough to automatically censor the e-print archive. ( It reminds me of when AOL censored a page on breast cancer ) But also , it is good to have a separate domain so the archive isnt always organizationally affiliated with LANL .
