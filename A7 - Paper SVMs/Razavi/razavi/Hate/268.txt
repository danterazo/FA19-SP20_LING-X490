Just fixing the header. Not wettest , but I think it pushed : 100 here today. It is indeed October. It cant be October. My calendar clearly states it is September. you are lucky , my stupid comps clock keeps telling me it august the 12th every time i boot upguess i ought to change it , or keep reliving august the 12th. I cant even remember if it was a good today to do over and overand out
