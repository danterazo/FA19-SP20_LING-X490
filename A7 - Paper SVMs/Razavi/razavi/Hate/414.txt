Did a Jewish girl turn me down ? No. It was " Polar " . " Polar " , not having read a word I said . well , one word , maybe . " Jews " . sought to capitalize on it by going into a tantrum , a diatribe. " Polar " , as far as can be understood ( Which is the best translation ? ) accused . who ? . Jews who go to movies on Yom Kippur ? for having caused the Holocaust and for not having read Santayana. So. I presented a postulate which " Polar " doesnt recognize. He does know the word " Jews " . ( Is " Jews " one word or more ? Is " Jews " many ? How many ? How many " Jews " going to movies on Yom Kippur are we talking about ? Wasnt the postulate syntheitic ? Hypothetical ? Were there any real Jews in my imagery ? ) Who knows what " Polar " saw in my brief writing ? He never said. What he did say was repeat of other words from other places but not anything in my post at all. " Polar " did not respond but reacted. The irony within . was that my post was in response to Michelle Gearys . whoever she is . she hasnt surfaced since . and to the quote or alleged quote . it is so hard to know . of Terry Gross . who thought . Geary said that Gross said . that only agnostics , Jews , and anti-social beans went to movies on Christmas. Did anyone here address THAT one ? IS it anti-social for Jews to go to movies on Christmas ? Is it anti-Semitic ? Is it anti-Christian ? What is it ? But " Polar " is ridiculous. Accusing " non-Jews " of " bad taste " in wearing American flag underwear. And if pious Jews wore decorator underwear ? or flavored underwear ? What if it is Kashress ? ( How does " Polar " know from peoples underwear ? it is called " underwear " because it is " under " , right ? Where is he looking ? ) And what of American Legionaires using American flag paper tablecloths and napkins at the Memorial Days picnics ? And what if some of those ( Legionaires ) were Jewish. And some are , I assure you. Some are. ) does that compound the problem ? ( If there is a problem ) and . how so ? And what of taste ? " Polars " favorite pejorative-adjective is " bad taste " . Was the Holocaust he raves about caused by bad taste ? I thought it was Hitlers war against the Jews. One could go on. Fed with sufficient encouragement , one will. But by the way . " Polars " no yeshva bucher. One reads writing. See this writing youve been reading here ? . if you got this far ? THIS is " yeshiva bucher " writing. neon , m .
