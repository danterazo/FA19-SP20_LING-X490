Or I could actually do my job. You may have a point. tex , youve failed to realize that our opinions on most of these things dont differ so widely. No , you sir are incorrect. I know that we dont differ widely , which is why I am endlessly fascinated by the rapidity with which you consistently respond to my posts and your ability to find that one little phrase I have posted that you do disagree with.

Remarkable. thanks. -pete ( buttmunch ? come on. ) it is a term of endearment. I am just conversing with you the way I do with most folks. If I really didnt like you I would just ignore you.
