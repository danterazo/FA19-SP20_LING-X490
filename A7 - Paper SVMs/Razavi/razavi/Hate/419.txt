Dear Beatle Fan : I got your address from Beatle-related chat rooms/web sites and/or the Amazon book review area. I dont mean to be intrusive or offensive - I am a sociologist and first generation fan with personal and professional interest in the world-wide community of Beatle fans. Ouch. The questions are depressingly centred around the USA. Bad start buddy ! : - ( Nothing is Beatle Proof !
