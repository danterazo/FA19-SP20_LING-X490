Did a Jewish girl turn me down ? No. It was " Polar " . " Polar " , not having read a word I said . well , one word , maybe . " Jews " . sought to capitalize on it by going into a tantrum , a diatribe. " Polar " , as far as can be understood ( Which is the best translation ? ) accused . who ? . Jews who go to movies on Yom Kippur ? for having caused the Holocaust and for not having read Santayana. So. I presented a postulate which " Polar " doesnt recognize. He does know the word " Jews " . ( Is " Jews " one word or more ? Is " Jews " many ? How many ? How many " Jews " going to movies on Yom Kippur are we talking about ? Wasnt the postulate syntheitic ? Hypothetical ? Were there any real Jews in my imagery ? ) Who knows what " Polar " saw in my brief writing ? He never said. What he did say was repeat of other words from other places but not anything in my post at all. " Polar " did not respond but reacted. The irony within . was that my post was in response to Michelle Gearys . whoever she is . she hasnt surfaced since . and to the quote or alleged quote . it is so hard to know . of Terry Gross . who thought . Geary said that Gross said . that only agnostics , Jews , and anti-social beans went to movies on Christmas. Did anyone here address THAT one ? Terry Gross is/was the host of the interview show FRESH AIR on NPR out of Philadelphia. She was probably telling an anecdote about her childhood in response to one of her interviewees. Michelle G. merely quoted her. Do the boogie woogie in the South American way Hank Snow THE RHUMBA BOOGIE
