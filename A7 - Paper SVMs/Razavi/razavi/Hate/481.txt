( big cut ) Since you ( e.g. , Charliew ) work for an oil company , how do you feel about what is happening in Nigeria ? .the people starving while those who run the place gather their millions/billions ( along with Shell and BP Amoco ? ) Do oil companies not have consciences ? .apparently not Do the people who work for oil companies have consciences ? I will let you answer that one. The last time I checked , it was the function of government to ensure a system of laws and procedures that allowed people to survive and prosper. Why isnt the Nigerian government taxing the oil companies in order to support its population ? Whether or not you realize it , Jean , it is the primary function of corporations to maximize their profits for their stockholders. This is more amoral than immoral , but corporations are NOT legally , ethically , or morally bound to provide for the populations of foreign governments. If you think otherwise , you are living in a fantasy world. SUVs are unnecessary " power toys " .a fool and his money are easily parted.hooked in to the " feel powerful " psychology of car manufacturers. Your opinion. Some communities are having to expend funds to re-design their parking lots because of the SUV to accommodate the wider sizes. I saw it on 60 minutes so it has just got to be true g Riiiiight . I dont pretend to have all the answers. I dont pretend to even know what the questions are. Hey , where am I ?
