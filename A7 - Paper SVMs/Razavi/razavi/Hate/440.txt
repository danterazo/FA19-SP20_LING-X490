belched forth this foul matter from their bowels : I see , MTV give correct information and I just talk out of my butt. Yeah , thats it. pop up video is on vh1. And VH1 is just MTV for old people. Come on , they are the same company even. i also read the same thing in one of my moms issues of enterainment weekly. what source do you have that says he is still a member of the the facist party ? Hester. So there. You wan na step to the Hestress , be my guest. At least the city of Amsterdam has seen fit to finally pull the plug on MTV Europe. MTV wants money from Adam cable which is bullshit , so the city just said no. HA ! this clearly makes them better people. Indeed. Besides , they have their own music video network thats just as professionally put together and has less annoying VJs.
