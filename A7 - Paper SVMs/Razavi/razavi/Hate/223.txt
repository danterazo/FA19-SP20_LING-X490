On Fri , 01 Oct 1999 -0600 , jerome rondeau This is a forum for discussing books and short stories in the genres of scince-fiction/ fantasy genres. You have not been dicussing anything even remotely connected to the said purpose of the group , and am taking up my time posting your off topic threads. Please dont be offended personnally but , GET THE FUCK OFF THIS NEWS-GROUP. Just one question. Who the hell are you talking too ? Oh , I think he must be talking to me , because I keep rising to the bait of silly pronouncements about education. mea culpa. My only on-topic excuse is that the sf I write is often about different sorts of ed. situations. Of course , he could be one of those people who keep screaming at the Backto1913 person for being off-topic , but that doesnt make sense to me. he is really , really , strange and annoying , but he always attempts to be on-topic ( see Coyus post on edible oils for an explication of these attempts ) . The rest of us , comfortable in the knowledge that the " s " in " sf " usually stands for " specualtive , " ( or ought to ) speculate right along with only occasional Obsfs to anchor us to the newsgroup. Lucy Kemnitzer obsf : oh , the brother and sister act in the Ender books .
