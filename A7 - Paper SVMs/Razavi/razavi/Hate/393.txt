Fender Blackie Strat made out of a 50s style multiradius Warmoth neck ( maple and sooo sweet ) probably about a 12 " radius ala SRV. Black body , Kluson Tuners , Kohler Brand Vintage Trem. Amer. Standard Pickups. Sounds fatter than my Relic Strat ! THIS GUITAR IS NOT A FENDER BLACKIE STRAT. GET OVER IT. I SEE THIS ON HARMONY CENTRAL AND HERE ALL TOO OFTEN. GET A GRIP DUDE , THIS IS NOT A REAL FENDER , AND NEVER WILL BE. FENDER SETS THE STANDARD , EVERYONE ELSE FOLLOWS. LOOKS LIKE YOU DID TOO .
