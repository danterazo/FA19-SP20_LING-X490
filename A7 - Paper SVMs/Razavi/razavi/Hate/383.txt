God , I sure am glad that I dont continue to be held 100 % responsible for all the stupid things I did when I was 18 , like Sgt. is Max. Age 18 might be considered an adult where voting and the draft is concerned , but I know I was just a stupid kid then. But , then again , when I was 15 I dated a man who was 21 , so I can see where Max is coming from. Java , I am holdiong Max " responsible " becasue Max continues to exude his " innocnece " . The fact is that he does not have any regret for his past actions. He feels he was not even wrong and has yet to admit that he was wrong. Was he a stupid kid ? No doubt. Does he admit he was guilty ? Nope. If you were 15 , when you dated that guy , he was wrong to be dating you. We both know that. This country is not all trailer trash from Apilachia ( sp ) . Fraternally , Walt Sgt.
