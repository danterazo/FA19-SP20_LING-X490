Okay , I want some good sexy SF books. Not " spank " books ala John Norman , but rather some well done SF books where you get a little more than , " And after , they saved the Universe. " Something that should probably say " Adult " on the cover ( like Heavy Metal ) , though it doesnt have to ( like Anais Nin ) . Suggestions ? Or are there no well written smutty SF ? christopher El articulo es demasiado grande para su apartado .
