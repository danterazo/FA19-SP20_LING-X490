Dont miss it : The picture of Tom Moran in the current : ( Oct. 4 ) issue of the New Yorker , page 86. : The hell you say. TM has not exhibited any typographic awareness that : I have seen. Put that in 72 point h1BLIPPO/h1 ( tm ) , Teeter. Maybe not awareness , but unexplained prejudices. I was thinking of his comments on the Raffel translation of _Don Quixote_. The only reason he could offer for not liking it was the typeface. However , a well-made book is an added pleasure and in this respect the original edition of The Towers of Trebizond from Collins is a true delight. Even if TTOT was only so-so , which of course it aint , the way the book is put together invites reading. Worth looking for in 2nd-hand shops .
