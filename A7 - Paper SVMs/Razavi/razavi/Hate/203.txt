Few people now call household with an annual income of $ 100,000 middle class. Even folks Bullshit. Mutual funds , 401 ( k ) plans , and ETrade bring those afforementioned growth stocks within range of the middle and lower classes. Especially outfits like T.

Ability to invest is not an issue ; if there is a financial system holding back people with modest means , it is self-inflicted through consumer debt , payday loans , and horrible TV/furniture rental deals .
