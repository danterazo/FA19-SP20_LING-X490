It is acutally a schedule III which is a real joke. The schedules are supposed to be based on potential for being habit forming ( of which anabolic steroids have a very low potential for PSYCHOLOGICAL abuse ) and are essentially NON TOXIC. Before I get flamed to death , hear this out. I am speaking of one time dosing , not the asshole who takes tons of 17 a-alkylated oral steroids and grams of testosterone esters for an indefinate period of time. Also some anabolics such as Anadrol ( relatively hepatoxic ) and a relatively benign and mild steroid such as nandralone decanoate ( Deca Durabolin ) can not be be grouped together as being " bad " Many HIV " + " and multiple scrlerosis patients have been helped by some of these drugs. I myself have been holding my breath for a long time for a extremely long acting low dose testosterone este ( with several months duration ) to be used as a male contraceptive .
