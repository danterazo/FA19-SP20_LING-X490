Right out of the Prison/Industrial Complexs playbook. You are a good robot. Guess you need no winding from me. MAX " In spite of what the artcle alleges , the PLS looses most of its cases. " Nice touch " alleges " whenever facts posted are not in your persona of what is " real " . What a wonderment " denial " must be UNTIL.what ? I am sure you do have cases that caused you to question at one time or another whether the whole world was nuts or just you. Did you come up with an answer ? LOTS OF LOVE MAX Gee , Max , If you read that article you would think that PLS won all of its cases. Far from it. If they won .05 % it was a lot. Take for example the case where they on behalf of an inmate at Marcy Correctional Facility sued the State because their " clients " ice cream was soft , claiming a violation of his constitutional rights. PLS was the source of many nusance cases. Very little substance. Fraternally , Walt Sgt. NYSDOCS " If ya cant do the time , dont do the crime !
