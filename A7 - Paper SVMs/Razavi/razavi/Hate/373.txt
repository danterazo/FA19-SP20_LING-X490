Hello : I hope you Gurus will tolerate an slightly off topic post. I recently upgraded my computer system from an old P90 system to a 350 PII one by moving the hard-drives ( a 2 gig and a 1 gig ) and other useful cards from the old box to the new box. No problems there. OS/2 handled it beautifully. However. Now the computer store has convinced me that I should turn the old P90 box into a Linux box , and sold me the required hardware which included an 8 gig Harddrive ( Smallest one they had on the shelves ! By the way did you see that IBM is now selling a 73 ! Gig HD ? ? ) . I am using Warp 4 FP11. Of course before I install Linux I need to install OS/2. ( I am a Linux idiot , so I want something familiar to fall back on ) . Problems now. 1 ) The Bios wont auto detect past 2 gigs. It has 3 settings for a 2 gig HD ( normal , Large , LBA ) , if I can partition the HD to an intial 2 gig size , can I use the Bios anyway ? It is an old ( 1995 ) Award Bios. I have updated the OS/2 Install diskettes with the FDISK and IBM1S506.ADD on my boot partition. I am hoping that if I can install OS/2 in the first 1024 cylinders that it will look beyond the 2 gigs that the BIOS is limited to. Is this right ? My thinking is that if I can get BootManager and/or LILO to install in the first part of the HD then I can install Data and Swap partitions in the other part. Anything else I need to do or watch out for ? Is there a central repository for BIOS updates if I cant find my Mother Boards manufacturer ? Thanks for listening to this OT post - I have come to trust the advice given here , and didnt want to start with a new NG. Seth I wont be able to check NGs until monday. Thanks again )
