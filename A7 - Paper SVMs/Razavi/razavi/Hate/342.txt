i have a practical question , how does one take Viagra in a relationship where spontaneous sex is the norm ? ? ( and stop laughing , I am serious ! ) It doesnt hurt to take it and not have sex ; ) Very painful in a financial sense , though. Unless you have a PRN prescription fully covered by insurance .
