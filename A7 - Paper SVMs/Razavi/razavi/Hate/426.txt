Chuck , Thanks much for the info. it is confusing at the MS site , the file looks like a driver for the MS Sidewinder stick only. And did MS have- to put a picture of their stick on the thing ? ! ? ! g. I am backed up , so I will try it. I am assuming this will work fine with W95 OSR2. Also assuming the SW3dpro.vxd is located in the file you mentioned ( will search for it after unpacking , and drop it in the system directory if not already there ) . Dang it how -do- you find all this stuff so easily at Microsoft ? ? ! ( hehe ) . Matt 1 ) Download 2 ) Run/install SWGameEN.exe ( version 3.02 ) 3 ) Then copy SW3dpro.vxd to the windows system dir. Then the OS will see the game controller ! Hope this helps ! P.S. Microsoft committed a large gaffe by not including this vxd file with Win98SE. It is for everybody who uses WIN98 ( SE too ! ) and whos joystick is listed as " not connected " . The updated virtual display driver is called sw3dpro.vxd version 3.00.01. One should also download the latest game controller software : SWGameEN.exe ( version 3.02 ) Thanks for posting some filenames ; time to " venture " into MS-world , and find this sucker. For some reason , I have a really hard time finding anything at MS , file-name searches always seem to give " zero " results. Btw , I found the same filename with HotBot , but am not sure it is the lastest driver. it is worth the try though , will get the file from HotBot and see if it is v3.02 or newer ( about 6mb DL ) .
