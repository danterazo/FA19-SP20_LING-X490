The Greeks are humiliating themselves all over the world. There are Greek organizations that visit sick people in hospitals. They think that anyone with a Greek last name is automatically Greek. But this is not true because the Greek government changed the names of the Macedonians living in Aegean Macedonia into Greek in 1926. That is why it was embarassing for the Greeks when they came to visit my aunt in the hospital. She does not speak Greek but her name was changed into Greek against her will. Ilinden Where did they meet your aunt ? In a hospital or . ? Does she have a name or she is no-name as your irrefurable evidence ? Are you brain-damaged or not ? Are you taking drugs or not ? Are you racist or not ? Have you realised that you talk the same language with all the Slavs or not ? Some questions you have to answer to yourself first !
