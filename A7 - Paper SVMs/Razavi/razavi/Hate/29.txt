Whats-her-face the album is tenatively titled " Smarmy , Robotic Candidates Robots arent smarmy ! This just reminds me that we can expect Arthur C. Clarkes _The ^ Bicentennial Man_ as a movie , soon. Jim Carrey as the main robot guy. I saw a poster over at the Cinerama , in downtown Seattle. I think you mean Gentry Lees. You both misspelled " Isaac Asimov " . HTH ! HAND ! Bob Gad. I have completely occluded his auxiliary troll. Thank goodness you bit it. I should hope this movie will be at least as good as the cinematic version of " Against the Fall of Night " was. Actually I dont think it matters very much .
