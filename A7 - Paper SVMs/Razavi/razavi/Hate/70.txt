Using the RSU methid , the installation of IBMs latest FixPack release ( FP12 ) was a piece of cake this morning. Here it has turned into a nightmare. I got increasingly bizarre error messages and the system is now totally wedged. HOW DO I BACK OUT of a fixpack from the text-mode command line accessible early at boot time ? The system wont go any further. More detailed history and symptoms : The system started at FP11 and has a new CDRW ( SCSI ) that replaces a CDROM ( IDE ) , but that configuration was working for 2 days prior to FP12. The RSU installation went as far as the reboot. First problem was that it announced that device VCSHDD.SYS was bad. Pressing " enter " lets the process continue , and all the other device drivers load , but then the system comes to a crashing halt ( C-A-D does not work ) with the message that : " The file PMMERGE-PMVIOP.122 specified in the PROTSHELL statement on line 2 of the CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a valid program. Line 2 is ignored. System stopped. " Now , the CONFIG.SYS does not contain any such nonsense , its line 2 is the perfectly normal PROTSHELL = C : \ OS2 \ PMSHELL.EXE I would rather not have to reinstall everything from the beginning !
