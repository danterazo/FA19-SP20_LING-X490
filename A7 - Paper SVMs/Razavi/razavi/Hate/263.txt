Just remembered.I DO like an ale really well too. Called Fat Tire. it is brewed up in denver and therefore I can get it fairly cheap down here. I was kayaking up near Ft Collins , and we stopped at the Mishewaka Inn on the Cache La Poudre river. The waitress was telling us about the beers they had , Fat Tire , Red Ass , and some others , and this buddy of mine told her to give him " one of those fatass beers " ! She shoulda drawn hin 1/2 Fat Tire and 1/2 Red Ass , and made him a Fat Ass ale.
