I think part of the problem is that doing a sync remix for Revolver-Mystery Tour is VERY difficult. It should be fairly easy for the 8-track since theorectically they can just remix the 8 tracks straight with no jiggery pokery. Yes , with the 4-tracks ( espercially 66-67 ) the parts come from two , three , or four source tapes. With the 8 tracks , it is all first generation except for a few when they started with a 4-track and copied that to 8-track. Jud McCranie I will tell you , I just listened to Revolver this morning ( on speakers , the way it was meant to be listened to ) , and dammit , that album is mixed very nicely ( except for the couple of mistakes ) . Even Taxman , which everybody seems to bitch about , rocks. Yeah , headphones really change everything. But the balances were right on Revolver. The album really rocks. The vocal levels are right. So , the panning is a little wonky here and there. Big deal. I for one would not look forward to a remix of Revolver. Especially with no ADT. DC Danny Caccavo " Where is Elvis ? "
