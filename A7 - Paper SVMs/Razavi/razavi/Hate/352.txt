I charge a fee for belt testing. Why ? Well , as you might guess , it is to make extra money. I dont make that much. Our school only has 8 belts , and the test runs between $ 20 and $ 100 bucks. Why not just raise the monthly fee a little ? It would reward the students that stay and youd get a little extra from the ones that leave. Marketing , marketing , marketing. When a student is presented with the school that says $ 50/month ( and doesnt charge for belts ) versus the one at $ 45 ( but does charge ) , who gets the nod ? And no matter how many times you tell them why you charge more , and that it is cheaper in the long run , they never listen. Why do I use belts ? At first we didnt. We were a " traditional school " . But guess what. People want belts. Prospective students would come in and say " How come no one wears belts ? At karate school X they all have belts. " One of the mcdojos in town puts a black belt up on the wall for you when you join the " black belt club. " The idea is that it is a constant reminder of your goal ( to which I think , shouldnt your goal be to become a powerful martial artist ? But I digress ) but for the guy walking in the door , the impact instead is " wow , this must be a great school , look at all the black belts. " Our ranking system is minimalist at best ( four ranks , one of which is posthumous ) and we get all kinds of questions about belts from prospects. Our school environment is very different from the run of the mill , and we tend to attract and keep a more select group. If people wanted to strap a ferret onto their asses during class would you accept that too ? ; Whoa , sign me up ! Thatd be one way to improve my footwork. Of course , I would offer " ferret on yer ass " courses for a nominal monthly surcharge - assuming I could get my ferret to cooperate. Badger Before you buy .
