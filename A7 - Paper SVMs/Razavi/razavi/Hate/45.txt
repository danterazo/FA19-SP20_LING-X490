Well , someone else has already indicated that a resonance is a counter example. I think. Which I suppose means reactance , which , correct me if I am wrong , is the magnitude of complex impedance , goes through a maximum. But. I fail to see how a function can have a maximum is the slope is always positive. Think tan ( x ) " When you argue with a fool , chances are he is doing just the same "
