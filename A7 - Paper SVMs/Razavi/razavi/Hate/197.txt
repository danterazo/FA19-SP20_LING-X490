says. : says.Have you nothing better to do , Midtown ? This is what , : the fourth thread youve started with " Jews " in the heading. : Did a Jewish girl turn you down for a date or something ? You : seem a bit obsessed. : I have always been under the impression that Neon is Jewish. Funny that : you would assume the opposite. Why is it funny ? Isnt it natural , given his demonstrated ignorance and lack of sensitivity and remarks about " real Jews ? " I suppose it is just possible he is a self-hating Jew , but I doubt it. Perhaps you need more irony in your blood. : Not to mention prejudicedwhat is that remark " but it helps " : but pure pandering to stereotypes. : That is , I believe , an allusion to the old ad for Levys Rye Bread - " You : dont have to be Jewish to love Levys - but it helps ! " A very amusing : ad campaign. Maybe it was only run in New York. I dont remember it. It might have been amusing , but insinuations about Jews and shopping ( and by implication money and riches ) do NOT amuse me. Antisemitism under the veil of " wit " is still ugly in my book.
