My story ! My name is Raymond R. Kolenda. My truck number is 82378. My " CB Handle " is Tan Man. I have been with Gainey Transportation Services for over two and a half years. I have a spotless driving record and take great pride in working for this company. I am married with two small children. On August 25 , 1999 , after coming back from vacation. I learned that I have Small Cell Carcinoma in the advanced stage. I was mortified ; what did I do to deserve such a disease ? After extensive research , I discovered how I had set myself up for getting lung cancer. Smoking for thirty years , starting when I was just fifteen years old. Back then smoking was the in-thing to do ; everybody smoked. Today , driving a truck , I was smoking three packs a day. Only diet rivals tobacco smoke as a cause of cancer in the U.S. , accounting for a comparable number of fatalities each year. Animal ( saturated ) fat in general and red meat in particular are associated with several cancers ; both are strongly linked to malignancies of the colon and rectum ; saturated fats have been implicated in prostate cancer as well. The food from our diet is high in fat , salt and chemicals. On the road we dont get enough exercise , and we gain weight. I know I gained 45 pounds. Smoking , bad diet and not enough exercise can lead to cancer. Are you a candidate for cancer ? Purchase a gift from our web site and 5 % of the sale will go towards cancer research. Thanks , Ray Kolenda Unbelievable , Ray. Your original posting gets not one friggin related reply. But , as soon as some rambling asshole , Uncle Al in this case , writes some moronic babble , every asshole and their mother chimes in with their opinion. My guess is that your intentions were not to start this rediculous debate , just get some hits on your website , right ? Well , anyway Ray , best of luck. BTW , whats the url ? JJC Before you buy .
