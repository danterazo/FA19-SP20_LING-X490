Perhaps nobody directly replied to this post because : a ) It feels very " spammy " b ) They were unimpressed with the generosity of the scheme ( " .5 % goes to charity. " ) . c ) The guy didnt even include a URL ! Notice also how he hasnt bothered to correct the URL mistake posting gets not one friggin related reply. But , as soon as some rambling asshole , Uncle Al in this case , writes some moronic babble , every asshole and their mother chimes in with their opinion. My guess is that your intentions were not to start this rediculous debate , just get some hits on your website , right ? Well , anyway Ray , best of luck. BTW , whats the url ? JJC Before you buy .
