On Sat , 02 Oct 1999 + 0100 , in WELL isnt it interesting. A bunch of White Power Rangers are posting again in a.r , and suddenly , I am getting mail-bombed. Who are the " White Power Rangers " you are referring to , who are " posting again in a.r " ? What do they have to do with the alleged mail-bombing ? Why should we believe that you are really getting mail-bombed at all ? Because unlike folks like CarlD , I dont lie. I have never lied in my posts. I believe you are being mail-bombed. And there is certainly no reason not to believe Sara ! I havent been mailbombed , but the other day , I did receive the following rather peculiar Couldnt find anything on " NetMasters SMTP Demo " , but I did find two posts apparent origin [ ns.mtu.ru ( HELO mtu.ru ) ( 195.34.32.10 ) ] and content were exactly the same. Interestingly enough , the " X-Recipient " line also referred back to the first recipient on the apparently random list. What do you make of this , Mr. McClelland ? [ rest deleted ] hro = Hilary Ostrov You know , Hilary , I got the same thing , and I just took it as spam. I figured some doofus had harvested names from a.r. So , just now , I checked it and thats what it isa blank page with a couple of banner ads is all. Spamarama. Dep " Always tell the truth. it is the § " Truth is just.truth.
