Er , you are using a Japanese rank - 10th dan. Call him a violet sash or something. Nah- the roundeyed sinowannabees have to accept that right along with using their pajama pattern , any variation on their ranking system , their concept of lineage and authority , lots of their words , lots of their religious and philosophical concepts and the rest of the sinophilic stuff , will come using their valued ritual words and honors right along with it. It is about like the old belt washing story- just another mythos for salesmanship. First they had one belt , then they had three , three became twenty , twenty became a hundred. Now , who has any idea what a particular piece of cloth is worth that isnt issued by their own club. The utter plethora of belts , sashes , colors , stripes , bars , bells , flowers , kanji , badges , patches , pins , tattoos , commemorative knives , pajama trim , medallions , bracelets , secret decoder rings and funny hats is beyond any codification at all. It is best just to realize how hard your honors are to achieve and be satisfied with it. It is nothing to me that someone has a 5th dan black unless he tells me who from. There are just too many of them floating around from Franks Karate Shop and Stormdoor Factory , Inc. 10th Dan claims are only more pretentious by definition. Chas
