why was domain alias given for the LANL Eprint archive ? I noticed both these DNS entries map to the same IP address. The address seems to take longer to connect than the direct. hmm ? also why didnt they make it the capital X is awkward when typing fast hehe. I suppose they couldnt make it or it would get wasted traffic from porno seekers ! eek. " Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have faith. " - John 20 : 29
