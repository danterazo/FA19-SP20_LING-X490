" Once again CarlD decides to use insults and racial slurs instead of actually trying to prove his point. Is there any reason anyone should believe this racist idiot ? God , you are stupid ! I said " Dont believe me , look it up for yourself. " Another typical white power ranger tactic : Assert something ( such as " there are lots of hate crimes faked by blacks " ) .
