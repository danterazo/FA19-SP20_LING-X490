I guess Doug isnt talking about the asinine , easily-disproved beliefs about what happened in the Americas ca. 2kya. And what beliefs are these exactly ? see arlier comments about mormon archaeology , and the trsutworthiness of sources investigating data which conflicts with deply-held beleifs. more would be off-topic. So maybe it is the bit about a dark skin being a sign of Gods disfavour ? Who believes this exactly ? Please note : Doung said " racist background " .Beleif today is antoher question. mormon history is , again , off-topic here , but if you truly dont see the racist background to Mormonism , you only re-affirm Dougs comment. I will say no more. [ squink ]
