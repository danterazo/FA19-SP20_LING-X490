special thanks to colin , whos amusing tale this poem does not reflect , merely the term , for mom , he came up with. Enigmadom Mom - there is no forgiveness for those who trespass against her they play with fire trodding a path foolish in ignorant damnation ! we would rally to her as we let them know with our moms house we get to live in her many mansions and in her back yard there is plenty of room to bury the unworthy and ignorant who would mistake her first name. heh make me famous will ya. love and kisses , moms bitch. Still trying to beat out Laura for the pool house ? I have added my sons bus driver to the burial list. And you thought youd have a lot of time on your hands ! E.M .
