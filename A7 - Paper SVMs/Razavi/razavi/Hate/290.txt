if you want to install OS/2 on a IDE drive larger than 4.3 GB , youll need to download a patch from IBM ( " how " is anyones guess , considering one usually doesnt have an operational PC before installing the OS. ) . I dont think thats true nowadays. Most folks whore interested in OS/2 , like the fellow who began this thread , already have at least one OS installed ; and if they do their homework first will have the IDEDASD.EXE fix at hand before installing OS/2.
