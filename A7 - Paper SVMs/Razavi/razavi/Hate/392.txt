For sure ! I have certainly never heard of having to replace spokes because of a defective rim ? ? The freakin spokes dont even touch the rim ! ( the nipples do. ) Though I have built up one brand new rim that turned out to be crap , just very hard to true up even when it was brand new and always falling out of true at one particular point , I find it nearly impossible to believe that one could look at a " brand new " rim and not notice that it was " all banged up. " Sounds like either this guy was just making all this crap up ( I love all the threats what a chump ! ) or really got juiced by his LBS ( imagine that ! ) and just doesnt know it. Whatever. Brian
