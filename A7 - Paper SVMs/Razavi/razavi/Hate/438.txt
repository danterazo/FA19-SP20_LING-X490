Blaming Yoko is an lame excuse , plain and simple , and a sexist , racist one at that. Many people dislike Yoko Ono for reasons having nothing to do with her sex or race. They usually find her music to be talentless or obnoxious and they perceive her as having been a destructive influence on something they loved , the Beatles. it is interesting to note that , throughout this debate , no one has offered any other rational explanation besides sexism and racism to explain why some people harbor so strong a dislike of Yoko Ono that they will point to her personally , as opposed to Johns love for her , as a contributing factor in the breakup of the Beatles. All kidding about digestive biscuits aside , read Get Back the Unauthorized Chronicle of the Beatles Let It Be Disaster for an authoritative account of problems Yokos behavior caused with the inner-workings of the Beatles. To me , there is no other rational explanation why one would choose to " dislike " someone one has never met and " known " only through the distorted fun-house mirror of " the media " and " the devils radio. " Probably everyone in the world dislikes people they know only through the wacky fun house media mirror. I could rattle of a list a mile long of people I despise for their deeds as well as personalities. Pat Bucannon , O.J. Simpson , Cathy Lee GIfford and so on. Why should Yoko Ono be different just because she is the widow of a dead rock hero ? To me , there is no other rational explanation why one would choose to " dislike " someone one has never met and " known " only through the distorted fun-house mirror of " the media " and " the devils radio.
