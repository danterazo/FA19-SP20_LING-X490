the is the biggest amount of crap I have read in a long time. how the fuck do you think great artists got great , beating off ? they polished their craft , ya bonehead , the GOT better by working at it. so spare me , and all of us , that hippy-bullshit theory that being creative is a " natural " happening. you get good at anything by learning your craft , whether it is writing a poem , making a dress , carving wood , counseling others , anything.
