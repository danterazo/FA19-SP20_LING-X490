No , one also needs to know what a " coaxial balance wheel " is , and a bit about the role it plays in the pocket watch in question. Actually , that was my screw up. I should have written that the balance wheel is positioned coaxial with the axis of the watch , as I found state in the original text when I got around to looking it up. ( The balance wheel itself is a type of torsion pendulum , the same thingies that played such a major role in the solution of the longitude problem in global navigation. ) That refers to a spring and rotating mass that takes the place of a pendulum. It rotates back and forth as a simple harmonic oscillator , and near the end of each " swing " knocks a pawl out of the tooth on a ratchet , and knocks another pawl into place so the ratchet can turn by one click. The rate that the clock moves is pretty much equal to the period of the balance wheel. Think you can do the problem now ? Hmm. First of all , I never learned what a " pawl " is - it is one of those words like " gimbal " and " sprocket " that for some weird reason people always say right before I tune out and stop paying attention. For some people , mathematics jargon has this effect - for me , it is gadget jargon. So all I know about " pawls " is what you just told me. That doesnt matter because it doesnt enter the first order periodicity computation. It does have rather nasty second order effects however , since it determines the amplitude of the balance wheels ( pendulums ) oscillation. This is of course the reasond that real Grandfathers Clocks are driven by weights and not springs. Confused ? Youve a right to be ! This is starting to read like the script of that PBS TV show " Connections " ! snip harry C. in strange mode I have a grandfather clock. Since you all seem to be wondering around , I will ask this question thats been on my Lifes Mysteries list. Will my grandfathers clock keep the same time on the moon ? /BAH Subtract a hundred and four for e-mail .
