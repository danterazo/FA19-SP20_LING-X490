It is acutally a schedule III which is a real joke. The schedules are supposed to be based on potential for being habit forming Actually , if Congress passes a law , the Schedules can mean anything they want it to mean. : Consistency was never the hallmark of the DEA Schedules , even before the Anabolic Steroid Control Act. Also some anabolics such as Anadrol ( relatively hepatoxic ) and a relatively benign and mild steroid such as nandralone decanoate ( Deca Durabolin ) can not be be grouped together as being " bad " The law has little to do with the potential of harm to an individual ; it was a rather hamfisted attempt to control a large underground market of diverted prescription anabolic steroid products ( whose true market , at least by 1990s standards of medical practice was orders of magnitude smaller. ) Before the Federal law , failing to account for your inventory of anabolic steroids from production to wholesale distribution to pharmacy might have gotten you into trouble with your accountant or auditor , or perhaps with a state regulatory board if a state had already scheduled these drugs. Now these are much more closely tracked. Many HIV " + " and multiple scrlerosis patients have been helped by some of these drugs. Yeah , like oxandrolone ( ne è Anavar ) whose patent had long since expired and which after being abandoned by Searle was " resurrected " as an " orphan drug " and is now being sold to HIV + patients as Oxandrin at a ridiculous markup. Something is VERY broken in this process. I myself have been holding my breath for a long time for a extremely long acting low dose testosterone este ( with several months duration ) to be used as a male contraceptive. If there was ever a chance of this coming to market , it was deep-sixed by the DEA scheduling , and the prevailing prejudice against even legitimate uses these days. Steve Dyer
