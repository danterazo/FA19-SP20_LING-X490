You strike me as a coward , Jim : I feel a hint between my shoulder blades. SAO P.S. I apologize if I am wrong. Sir , a coward I may be , but I certainly was not aiming any hints at you. Surely you can not have forgoten that I have praised your work lavishly ( for me ) , even to the point of coveting your ear , which I know you remember because you even cited the fact in a response to , I believe , Marek. No , I have not forgotten. Nor have I forgiven you , because your praise has weighed me down. Not your fault , Jim. I have never learned how to deal with love ( for lack of a better word ) . Hate gets me going , love gets me down. Without success failure has no meaning , which is to say only when youve succeeded does failure become an overwhelming concern. SAO
