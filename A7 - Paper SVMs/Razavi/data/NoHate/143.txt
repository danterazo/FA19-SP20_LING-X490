Unless I am mistaken , thats the definition of deflation that prices drop and income doesnt. Ergo , the above is just flat-out wrong. Nope. Deflation simply means prices are declining ( or to be more precise , the value of money is increasing , which is the same thing. ) There isnt any special consideration made for the price of labor vs. the price of anything else. APL is a mistake , carried through to perfection. It is the language of the future for the programming techniques of the past : it creates a new generation of coding bums. Edsger W. Dijkstra , SIGPLAN Notices , Volume 17 , Number 5
