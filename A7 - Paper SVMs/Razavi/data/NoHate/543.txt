I was surprised noone ansewered. Newsgroups are usually so effective if you want to learn something fast. This time it was trial and error. I now hope someone could help me with another problem. I have a 1024768 fullscreen frame and one that a picture in the back. Text scrolls and zooms smoothly on top. Now I need to start a movie , but it is behind all of it. It starts and sound comes thru , but no picture. How do I get it in front ? This is Direct Draw 7 , so it is not a focus problem. Can I set priorities on the movie frame to go in front of everything ? Or if not , how to clip it to the background screen ?
