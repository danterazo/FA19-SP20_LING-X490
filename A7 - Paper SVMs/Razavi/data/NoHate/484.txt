It is quite possible that the manufacturer left the windows installation flats on your hard drive somewhere. Oftentimes these will either be in a directory off from the root of your boot drive ( ie c : \ win95 ) , or in the c : \ windows \ options \ cabs directory. look for files ending with the extension .cab , and if you find any that look like this : " win95_ # # .cab " , those are the compressed setup disks for windows. Disk 21 would be win95_21.cab. If these exist there , just point the quickview setup program to the directory that the .cab files are in. Another thing to do is to go to Viewoptions from explorer , and then to the file types tab. There will be a list of files sorted by extensions , associated with their respective file handler. Find the extension listing for the type of attachment you are trying to open and make certain it is pointing to the right application as a file handler , or , if one doesnt exist , try and use other file associations as examples of how to set on up for that extension yourself. I can not open certain attachments to my e-mail. The message I get is " No Viewers " and to create an association in Add/Remove by clicking Quick View. When I do , I get the message that I need to insert Windows 95 Disk 21. My Windows was pre-installed in my computer package. My computer is Hewlett Packard Pavilion 7055. Thank you very much.
