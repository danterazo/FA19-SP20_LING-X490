Hi Damir Yes we did some testing in that which are successful , have a look at the that. Bye , Oliver Has anyone used Firewall-1 with secure remote to login to the firewall and to an NT domain ? Is this possible ? What I would like to do is use either 95 or NT clients to login to an ISP and then using secure remote setup a secure VPN to login and authenticate to our NT network.
