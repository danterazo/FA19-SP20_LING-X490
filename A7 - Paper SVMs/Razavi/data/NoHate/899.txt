CBS news reports today the death of Pat Davis , a reporter covering the Sacramento beat for KNX in Los Angeles and occasionally for CBS national news feeds. He suffered a heart attack yesterday ( Friday ) and died soon after. He was 58 years old. Sorry if this is of little interest to easterners or midwesterners , but his voice is likely very familiar to Angelenos tuned to KNX. I knew Pat. He used to file for me all the time , when I was at CBS Radio. He was a good guy , and you could depend on him to get the story and deliver it on time. I am really sorry to hear he is gone .
