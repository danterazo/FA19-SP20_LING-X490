I saw the lightning people are talking about. It was during the earthquake that happened about 30 mins ago , 2 : 45am. There was maybe 4 or 5 flashes in the west sky during the shaking and rolling. There was no thunder associated w/ the light flashes. I saw them too , in San Diego. The ones we got were fairly unimpressive , rather like a flickering. Someone ( didnt catch his name either ) on KFI - AM radio ( Los angeles ) said this effect is caused by " arcing of transformers. " It did look a little like perhaps our street-lamp was flicking on and off , but we had no power failures - none of the electric clocks reset to zero. Our lightning like flickers seemed bluish-white , and seemed to be originating from the east and north. BTW folks - when you report the effects you felt , could you please mention your geographic location ? Thanks , all. Glad to hear there are no reports of serious injury , at least so far. " .not yet well understood. " - oft heard comment , seismic studies - M.Q.S. AKA The Lady in Green | M.Q.S. c/o T.L.S | " Dont play with that ! You have no idea where |
