The seven-day story is an obviously carefully crafted , unified piece of poetry. The parallel I mentioned is : 1 : Light separated from darkness 4 : Lights ( stars ) in the sky 2 : seas separated from heavens 5 : fish and birds 3 : earth separated from seas 6 : land animals and then plants and then humans ( 1 ) Light ( 2 ) Many days later , the sun Oy. There are other patterns ; for example , the first verse in Hebrew has seven words , setting up the overall seven-ness. Vey. Marc Marc Sulla
