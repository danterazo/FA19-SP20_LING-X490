[ fort77 ( a script to invoke f2c followed by gcc ) isnt g77 ] But its not g77. Different animal. You might even have both the fort77 script and g77 available in the same distribution as choices. One of the hardest barriers preventing g77 to be widely applied by Linux distributors is the fact that g77 is combined with gcc and g + + . Because the current g + + ( gcc-2.95.1 ) breaks binary compatibility w.r.t. egcs-1.1.2 , it is not installed on most Linux distributions. IOW , if you want to have the newest in Free Fortran , download gcc-core and g77 from the gcc-2.95.1 distribution at : Success !
