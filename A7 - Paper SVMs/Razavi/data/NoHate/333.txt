quoting me , kts : The Genesis account is full of patterns look at the parallel between days 1-3 and days 4-6 intended to get across , not literal details , but the idea that the creation was orderly. Correctly : There were ( no less than ) four authors of Genesis ; you read too much into their respective overlapping. you are confusing the seven-day creation with other places in Genesis where stories are repeated from different sources. The seven-day story is not repeated ; actually , it is contradicted by the Garden of Eden story which follows in chapter 2. The seven-day story is an obviously carefully crafted , unified piece of poetry. The parallel I mentioned is : 1 : Light separated from darkness 4 : Lights ( stars ) in the sky 2 : seas separated from heavens 5 : fish and birds 3 : earth separated from seas 6 : land animals and then plants and then humans Note the order-out-of-chaos theme. There are other patterns ; for example , the first verse in Hebrew has seven words , setting up the overall seven-ness.
