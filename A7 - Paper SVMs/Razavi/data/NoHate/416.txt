No one on this newsgroup has a problem answering newbies for the most part. As a matter of fact many take the time to answer the same questions over and over again. The problem is with things like I just dont have a compass I am in this deep canyon miles from anywhere I have to climb a mountain to find polaris. Common sense says this wouldnt happen you wouldnt be hiking without a compass. And you wouldnt have a scope that critical of polar alignment in the middle of the wilderness. Ask your questions but dont stretch them to the edge of reality. A lot of interesting things about finding north came out in the thread that I enjoyed reading all you needed to ask is about alternative methods of finding north instead of all the fantasy.
