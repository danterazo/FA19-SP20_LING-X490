Yes , MS Works has a " Wizard " for this , all he has to do is find which click under the taskbar will take him there. Been too long since I used works to remember where it is tho , sorry. Tell him to just keep pushing buttons till he finds it ! steph My dad has Microsoft Works , which I believe came with his computer. Anyway , does anyone know how to do mass mailing out of this. What he wants is to print envelopes , where the computer pulls addresses from his address book and just plugs them in. Does anyone know how to do this ?
