Boy have Trailers changed ! Steph , My MIL has a three bedroom , two bathroom double-wide that is bigger than my houseand probably cost more , too. it is gorgeous. In fact , it has pretty much the layout I want for my house. We dont really want a mobile home because of the problems we would have getting even half of a single wide through the woods to where we want to build the house. Our only choice is a site built houseand it has nothing to do with trailers because second or third rate housing. We have looked at them but in our case it isnt feasible to get one. we are not willing to tear down the fence and close to 100 trees just to get the thing in place. Carol American by birth.
