snip Think drum recorder Thats an alternative. But then , the signals may be represented differently on this recording medium which would have to go thru the intrepretation process all over again. Maybe it would work just fine , but that possibility is there. Ok , you have some sort of device that detects some sort of signals which you then interpret into a possible EQ prediction. All you have to do is have some device that records those signals while you are away. Then later , when you come home from the movies , you can review the record and do your interpretation then. A further point is that not only would a drum recorder prevent signals being missed when the instrument isnt being watched , it would also provide permanent records that could be passed around to interested parties.
