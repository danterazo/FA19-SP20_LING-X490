It does. However , that is not Descartes argument. Descartes is not saying " thinker exists. " Rather , he says " I think. " Just to muddy the waters , when RD thought , did he think , " Cogito , " or " Je pense " ? Does it matter that there is not the same kind of explicit thinker in " cogito " that there is in " Je pense " ? ( Or being in " sum " ? ) This bothered me a little some 30-odd years ago , when somebodys exegesis of the _Tractatus_ claimed that LW blew RD away by stating that the " I " in " I think " was simply a linguistic embellishment to call attention to the speaker. And now here is the perfect forum in which to bring it up. it is an interesting idea. However , for a native speaker ( or a fluent speaker ) of an inflected language , " cogito " or its equivalent would contain the " I " within it as obviously as " I think " . Or at least , so I think. If he wanted to avoid the " implicit " thinker , he could have used the infinitive. Larisa Migachyov Quaternion Press Publishing House Have a math question ?
