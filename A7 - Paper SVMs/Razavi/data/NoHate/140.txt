Upgrading is such in inexpensive option right now. In fact I have a Powerlogix 220 ( that I had running at 300 ) that I can sell you for $ 125. I have since ungraded to yet a faster card , so I dont need this one. And if you decide you want to upgrade another fantastic option is the Xlr8 Zif Carrier , which can handle G4 upgrades. the G4 upgrades are still way too expensive , but will become reasonalbe ina couple of months. Still , havning one of those new speed demons would be nice , and many is the time that I wish I had two machines. Shane King I read a lot of info about processor upgrades and audio programs and there have been problems with most all of them. You have to be carefull. There is considerable information that you shouldnt buy the sonnets at all if you are doing audio/video. The only ones that have gotten the clear go ahead in this area are the Newer Tech ones.
