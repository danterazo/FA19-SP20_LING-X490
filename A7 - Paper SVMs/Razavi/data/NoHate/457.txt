Just saw a posting on Suns web page and saw Staroffice for sale for 6.95. Actually the cd comes with three or four ports of the program. Is this collection of things worth getting for OS2 ? I seem to remember reading in the Linux groups that Staroffice ran slowly. Might be wrong though. I have StarOffice v5.1 installed on two machines here and conclude that StarOffice loves memory. there is no such thing as too much memory for StarOffice. On my OS/2 machine ( 5x86/133 32MB ) it takes about a minute to load and although slow at times it is usable. On my linux machine ( PII-350 128MB ) it takes about 7 seconds to load and is nice and snappy. So now I usually just use it on the linux machine , sometimes from the OS/2 box using XFree86 to connect to the linux box. SO is none too swift on a 412.5 MHZ oclocked AMD-K62 with 256 MB of RAM , 1 MB of L2 , multiple fast SCSI UWs. But once in RAM one forgets about that most of the time. It IS virtually ( perhaps totally ? ) immune to Word macro viruses I have been given from time to time by clients. On that score , it is welcome to an Athlon and 1 GB of RAM if it needs it. Hardware is cheaper then time. YMMV ! Bill Hacker PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS ! The sale of IBM.NET to ATT has resulted in an unannounced 299 % increase in certain charges , as well as lower quality !
