I dont have the tools or the knowledge to compile the source from later versions under XFree86/X11. Are you saying that I can run the OS/2 native code under XFree86 ? Yes ! The code needed for XFree has been added. it is a simple matter of specifying the device as explained on the page. And BTW , Ghostscript uses EMX anyway AFAIK. Will installing the OS/2 version 5.50 solve the " Cant find the gs_init.ps " file problem ? I think so if youve set the environtment variables correctly.
