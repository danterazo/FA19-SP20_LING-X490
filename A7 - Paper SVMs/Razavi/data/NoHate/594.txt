I purchased the same battery from Radio Shack about two weeks ago , and have logged about five hours with it without any noticable decay in performance. ( I use the ac adaptor from my driveway I use the battery " in the field " away from home ) . The charger seems overpriced. I intend to charge the battery using an automobile battery charger with a series resistor in order to limit the current to under 1 Amp. If this doesnt work , I will bite the bullet and purchase the charger. Chuck Not wanting to be forever purchasing AA batteries to power my Nexstar , I went to Radio Shack to see what I could find. They of course have rechargable AAs , but the fine print on the package says that they only put out 1.2 V fully charged. Remembering others comments that the N5 is fairly sensitive to voltage drop , I decided to avoid those. I ended up buying a 12V sealed rechargable lead-acid battery rated at 4Ah ( RS part # 23-289 ) and a couple of power cords , one that is two clips conected to a cigarette lighter style outlet , and a cigarette jack to 2.1 mm mini plug that fits the N5. The latter also would of course power the N5 directly from the car cigarette lighter jack. The battery cost $ 24.99 , is 2.7 x 3.5 x 4.0 inches , and weighs probably 2.5 or 3 pounds. The two power cords were $ 4.95 each or close to that. I have not yet gotten a charger for the battery. The combination works great , although I have not had it out for an extended period yet , and the power cord at $ 4.95 is a lot cheaper than the Celestron one at $ 19.99 ! _ Chuck Rosenblatt 41 ° 30 N ; 81 ° 31 W
