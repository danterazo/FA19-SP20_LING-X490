Subject : Re : I saw lightning in west sky during CA earthquake today ! I saw the lightning people are talking about. It was during the earthquake that happened about 30 mins ago , 2 : 45am. There was maybe 4 or 5 flashes in the west sky during the shaking and rolling. There was no thunder associated w/ the light flashes. KNX radio 1070 reports that an airplane pilot coming in at that time , at 10,000 ft over the LA Basin saw a marine layer at approximately 1000 ft and transformer and power line flashes lighting it up , like a midwest thunderstorm at night. He said " it looked like a war zone " with all the electrical arcs and line shorts. rlr I live in Costa Mesa and was wide awake. More interesting than the quake itself were the flashes , like heat lightening , that lit the entire sky. These were yellow/orange , not blue. There were at least 3 during the quake and there were two more after I stopped feeling any movement , within about 2 minutes. Then there were no more , and I stayed up for about an hour. What were these ? Exchange ideas on practically anything ( tm ) .
