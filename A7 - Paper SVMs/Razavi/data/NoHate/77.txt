When the Shaking Stopped , The Work Began For USGS Scientists Well , it is 3 : 15AM , the shaking stopped a half hour ago , and I still cant get through to any wr.usgs.gov sites. The TV stations are still on the air and none have said anything about it , so I am going back to bed just generally displeased. I believe CalTech shuts down their sites to prevent preliminary info from being given out. Luckily , they forgot to tie down the finger side No. Caltech and the USGS do everything they can to keep sites up so that information can be obtained in " real time. " I was able to access the site from home immediately after the event , and we shouldve been up ( but possibly swamped ) for several hours afterwards. We did have a server problem later in the morning and , because things were so generally crazy , it wasnt noticed right away. As far as I know , everything is completely operational now : as more info becomes available. Also a link to the " Community Intensity Map " page , and other assorted useful pages. ground motions Sue , speaking for myself Dr. Susan Hough Seismologist U.S. Geological Survey Pasadena , CA 91106
