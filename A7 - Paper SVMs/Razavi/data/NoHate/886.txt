Dan , I looked at the Amek web site. This sounds like the box you are talking about. " The SYSTEM 9098 Dual Compressor/Limiter , designed by Rupert Neve , provides Compression , Limiting and Ambience controls on each channel. The two channels may be linked for stereo operation. " Does anybody know where I might be able to rent one of these in the Boston area ? Roger First off.I dont do " REMOVE-THIS " .second.try using a bit of expansion. You can rent somethng like a Drawmer DS-201 from several sources.possibly even demo one from a place like Guitar Center/Daddys etc. Not having much experience with the 9098 comp.I am not sure what the Ambience controls might do.however , compession will increase the abundance of ambience , not reduce it.
