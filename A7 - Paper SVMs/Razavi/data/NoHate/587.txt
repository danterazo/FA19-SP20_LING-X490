I saw that too and I live in Tustin it was North east of my bedrrom windowany guesss as to what it actually was ? ? On the news they showed videotape of this sort of phenomenon ( taken just after the quake in Anaheim ) . They attributed the flashes to arcing between swinging power lines and/or exploding power transformers .
