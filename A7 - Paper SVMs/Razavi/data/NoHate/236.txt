Thanks Bob Axtel I checked out your site , however , I am looking for a software solution. ( The PIC chip is already used for other ctl fcns. I will try your other suggestions. By 50mv , I mean that the amplitude of the signal is .050 Volts , with a very slow ( equal to the width of the pulse ) rise time. The trailing edge is sharper. To Keith , I understand your suggestion is to poll the A and B channels. My chief concern is that I would like to have processor power left over for the PICs other control functions. If the only alternative is screening interrupts caused by changes on four channels ( I am using RB4-7 and edge detection on all four are ctlled by the same bit ) , then your way might be more economical of processor power. ps With the interupt approach , the chips response to interrupts would act as a low pass filter ( no problemo ) - which brings me to my other point. Are there other chips out there , as inexpensive as the PIC series , perhaps even in the PIC series , with the same programming support = popularity ( I built my programmer from plans on the web ) which would allow pull-up/interupt individually on three IO lines ? or perhaps even a peripheral edge detect fcn ?
