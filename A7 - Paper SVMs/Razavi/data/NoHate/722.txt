How does the 4047 compair to the 4050 ? I have a pair of 4050s and I was wondering if it would be worth adding the 4047. Much more body. The 4047 is thick and mellow where the 4050 is thin and crispy. You can use a 4050 on almost anything and get at least a halfway decent sound. I dont think I could say the same thing about the 4047. Thatd sit better with me if the 4033 didnt exist- I would agree with the 4047 characterization , but put the 4033 as thin and crispy ( or bright and clear , depending on where you are coming from ) , and stick the 4050 in the middle as fairly neutral.
