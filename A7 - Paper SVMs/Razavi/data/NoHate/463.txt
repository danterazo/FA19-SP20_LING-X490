Julie , Just because it is legal , doesnt mean we have to help ourselves out of a job. The point I am trying to make is that what you see as a black/white , right/wrong issue , I dont. And neither do many other people. I have very mixed feelings about the offshore transcription issue. I think that objectively my position is that we need qualified MTs RIGHT NOW. there is an extreme shortage. I dont think the answer is going offshore. If too many resources and efforts are concentrated offshore and pay rates to MTs continue to remain stagnant or drop , in five years there wont be enough MTs left who are qualified to proof the amount and quality of work coming from the offshore companies OR the speech recognition products. we had get better results faster if the time and effort was spent here in the US. I have yet to hear that any of the companies investing in offshore transcription have made any money. I would be interested in knowing if they have studied the long-term return on offshore v. US training , notwithstanding the tendency of Americans to whine and be overly demanding .
