Upgrading is such in inexpensive option right now. In fact I have a Powerlogix 220 ( that I had running at 300 ) that I can sell you for $ 125. I have since ungraded to yet a faster card , so I dont need this one. And if you decide you want to upgrade another fantastic option is the Xlr8 Zif Carrier , which can handle G4 upgrades. the G4 upgrades are still way too expensive , but will become reasonalbe ina couple of months. Still , havning one of those new speed demons would be nice , and many is the time that I wish I had two machines. Shane King Now available , the first album from RedGreenBlue , Red.
