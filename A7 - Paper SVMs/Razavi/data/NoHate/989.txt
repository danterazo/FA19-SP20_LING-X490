A very informative post. Very well done. Thank you Using the RSU methid , the installation of IBMs latest FixPack release ( FP12 ) was a piece of cake this morning. It is a little different than previous installations. With this procedure I received a message that my system needed further updating and I was instruced to bring up the Window List ( Control-Escape ) and select ( or run actually ) a new update program. This took me into a full blank screen that went into a procedure much the same way Warp is originally installed. When it was over I was asked if I wanted to delete the unneeded files ( said yes ) and to then reboot. I am back online and raring to go ! here is my syslevel information : OS/2 Warp 4 Service Level Version 1.00 Component ID 566933010 Type Fixpak Current CSD level : XR0M012 Prior CSD level : XR0M012 As you can see , I am not at FP12 level. I DID NOT install the Device Driver FixPak1 ( Yet ) but may do so later today. I just want to assure all you OS/2 folks that the RSU method does work ( now , it was not working late last night ) and it appears IBM has now got this software update procedure working well. If YOU want to upgrade to FP12 go here : If they wanted to offer an upgrade to Warp 5 this way it would be very easy to do. Tim Martin The OS/2 Guy Warp City " E-ride the wild surf to Warp City .
