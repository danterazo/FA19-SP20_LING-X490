I once made the mistake of loading Afterdark onto my windows 95 computer. I have deleted every Afterdark file I can find , but lurking somewhere in the entrails are instructions to the system about all the afterdark files that are no longer on my system. I have scoured win.ini , autoexec.bat , config.sys , etc. FirstAid 95 , for example , identifies the 100 or so disconnected afterdark files that I dont have. How do I get rid of every last vestige of this dark menace ? If you removed the program manually , instead of using Control Panel | Add/Remove Programs or Afterdarks own uninstall program ( if it has one ) , you will find debris scattered around the system. I would try installing it again and uninstalling it in one of those ways. Best Wishes , Steve Winograd
