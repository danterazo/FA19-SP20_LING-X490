On Sun , 03 Oct 1999 GMT , Matthew Devney Run that by me again. If suddenly everybody is rich , this is a bad thing ? Okay , granted , it cant last , but in the meantime it is all good. So please tell me why deflation is a bad thing. Okay hows this. You have mortgage of $ 50,000 on your house. Deflation sets in and the house is now worth $ 25,000. Congratulations , you will now be paying about 4 times the deflated value for your house. Not to mention the impact on your other debts. One big thing people overlook in a deflationary cycle , your income goes down. Companies will cut pay too at least match the level of deflation. Deflation leads to money hoarding , which draws more money from the market , leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible , buying only the baremost necessities , and this as late as he can. The result is , of course , collapse. Talk me through this , okay ? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5 % more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5 % more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing ? No , my friend , if you truly think that , then you are obviously no student of human nature. Only if prices drop to match the deflation rate. The prices that do drop should be food and very little else. Most durable goods price will remain the same until companies can figure out a way to drop them without going bankrupt. Your argument against deflation is that " it leads to money hoarding. " This is patently untrue , thus your argument has no base. Unless I am missing something. ? Income drops as Companies cut pay or have massive layoffs. Large Companies would be very hard hit. They are stuck with inventory and products that are highly overpriced and they can not cut prices with the suddenly increased debt hanging over them. The last great cycle of deflation was called the Great Depression. Hardly good times for the country .
