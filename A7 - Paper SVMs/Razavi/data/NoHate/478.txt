It seems that quite a bit of the " who would win in this situation " type of post in this newsgroup come down to a disscussion of BJJ/judo vs. other arts. Yes , that has been a reoccurig theme. A lot of the posts seems to favor BJJ in a fight , citing that most fights end up on the ground. The BJJers tend to say that , the non BJJers disagree. On the most recent of thise threads there have been some very prolific posters in the BJJ camp. I very recently starting studying Shorin-Ryu Karate , and from what I understand it emphasizes striking and kicking , with not as much emphasis on throwing and grappling. My question is this : where does this leave me in a conflict with a grappler ? Without empasis on at least counter grappling , this will leave yo uout of your element. The UFC is actually a god example here. The people who had never before delte with a skilled grapple found they cold not drop them fast enough to aviod a clench. If you are new , you school may address grappling later on in training , I would suggest asking. It is also common in many art to cross-train. Many schools down here have seperate Karate/Jujisu/whatever classes in the same school. More specifically , where would this leave someone practicing Shorin-Ryu when fighting a non-martial arts high-school/college wrestler ? Depends on the wrestler. On the up side , wrestling does not really teach approach of a standing , fighting opponent. On the down side , that is not hard to learn , and when they learn that , they can use their considerable skills. Again , I just recently started in the martial arts , and I just as recently started reading this newsgroup , so if this topic has already been covered to the point of exhaustion I didnt know it. Sorry to drag it up again. And thanks in advance for any replies. It has , but we will rehash it anyway. People that dont want to see it should block off this thread. Jerry Love
