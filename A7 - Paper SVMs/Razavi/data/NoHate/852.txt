Does anyone run IBM OS2 Warp and an Amiga System ? I did at one time. IBM stopped developing OS/2. Once I realized that fact , I abandoned OS/2 , and moved on to Linux. There is an effort to convince IBM to open-source OS/2. I still have my Amigas though. Huh ? You ran OS/2 on an AMIGA ? ? ! ? ! ? How ? ? ? And using what emulator ? ? ? What version of OS/2 you were able to run ? ? ?
