I think we should respond to the original question in the spirit in which it was posed. And that is : given this situation , try to come up with a method of finding true north. The absence of a compass was just to provide a parameter. In thinking about it , the direction in which stars drift come to mind. And , since he does have a telescope and he has told us the declination and he has it aligned at that angle , he could actually use the " star-drift " method to determine true north VERY precisely. If the scopes axis is pointing west of the pole , stars will drift south in his field of view. He could then use this to rotate the scopes axis accordingly. In fact , even if he didnt have a scope. he could place 2 sticks in the ground with their tips aiming at a star and notice several minutes later the direction they move - directly west .
