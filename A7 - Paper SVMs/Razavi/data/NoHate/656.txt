I can not open certain attachments to my e-mail. The message I get is " No Viewers " and to create an association in Add/Remove by clicking Quick View. When I do , I get the message that I need to insert Windows 95 Disk 21. My Windows was pre-installed in my computer package. My computer is Hewlett Packard Pavilion 7055. Thank you very much. Posted via CNET Help.com Many computers that come with Windows pre-installed have the installation files kept in the directory c : \ windows \ options \ cabs \ , you can try that path when asked for your installation disk. If they are not there , try searching the drive for files with a .cab extension if you find a bunch of them in the same directory odds are that those are Windows. Hope that helps.
