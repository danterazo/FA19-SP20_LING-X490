I have a new LS-2000 scanner which I have bought for couple of weeks. Yesterday I scanned my negative with the " ICE " turned off , I found all photos get one or two straight lines along the direction of film feeding besides the white dots of dust. I checked the film under strong light and believed the film surface has been scarched after passing through the SA-20 strip film feeder. I opened the SA-20 and found the scarch lines matched 2 of the plastic guiding webs at the rear inner compartment. I want to ask : 1 ) Anyone get the same problem ? 2 ) Is it caused by curved film strip ? 3 ) Shall I take the machine to service ? 4 ) How to avoid ? Thanks all ! NO problem with mine - but I dont use it often as it curls the film. First make sure it is the scanner. Check another piece of film from the same roll - one that has not been through the SA-20. If it has the same scratches then it is your lab. If not , look around for a piece of film you dont have any use for , like the strip that proceeds the first shot on the processed roll. The one with the labs number on it. Cut off that part and run it through the scanner - make sure it is NOT scratched before you start. If it comes back out unscratched put it through again. The problem may not happen every time , but obviously you dont want it happening at all. Nikon has a tech support web site complete with a forum. It never takes more than a day or two to get an answer ( except weekends ) it is at : The second one gets you directly to tech support but I may have it wrong. An iota of wisdom from Ol Phil Accept NO substitutes The BEST is none too good ! Before you buy .
