I agreed that the flaw in SR cancept as proposed by Einstein is the synchronization procedure. However , when applied as proposed , it IS totally internally consistent Especially , if , as he postulated , the absolute velocity of light in either his " empty space " or Lorentzs equally stationary ether , is correct. The only thing " inconsistent " is that he defined the result - offset local times per consecutive clock in the direction of a given systems absolute motion - as " synchronism " . They are " esynched " , not truly synchronous. Even so , taken together with physical q-contractions of lengths in the directions of absolute motion and physical q-dilatations of the rates at which clocks of differently moving systems beat ( in which q = 1/gamma ) ; the LTE do hold good wherefore so does Poincares wistful desire that the " laws of nature " ( i.e. Maxwells manmade-em equations ) will hold the same form regardless of which absolutely moving deformed esynched relativistic coordinate system is the chosen referent. glird
