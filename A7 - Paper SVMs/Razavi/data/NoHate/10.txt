You might consider Masaaki Hatsumis excellent work on " Stick Fighting " ( Tuttle,VT ) as a reference book and to begin to explore the breadth of stick assisted technic. I dont know of any other focus books I would recommend off hand- Dan Inosantos book on Filipino Martial Arts is an I finally got myself a copy of that from Amazon. I am impressed-different style than I am used to , but _exactly_ the type of stick mechanics that I was looking for as a basis to integrate into my personal style. Very good book.
