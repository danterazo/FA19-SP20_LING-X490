Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. My words. Gravity is related to mass as its acts on material structures. But that is all. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Thank you. Any refference ? Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work. To me with this work and Schnurers work the superconductor is too small to produce an observable change of weight. But I am not sure. And its hard to separate out the effect of the liquid nitogen fumes. I get a 2.9 % weight loss by illuminating the insides of a 0.82 m hollow aluminum sphere with 3000 watts of infrared heat. With a colander and the same power I get a 1.6 % weight loss. I have also made control runs to separage the spurious heat effects from the genuine gravity effects. Did you accont for convection of surrounding air ? I looked at your page and from what I could figure out , this aspect may have been omited. Another thing : My test mass looks more like a UFO than does Podkketnovs or Schnurers test mass. Why do UFOs hover silently ? Could they be kicking heat out the bottom like my 0.82 m hemisphere does ? UFOs are touchy when a light is flashed on them. When I take a photo of my device during a test a slight change of weight occurs at the instance of the flash from the camera. How good is this statement ? I mean how certain are you ?
