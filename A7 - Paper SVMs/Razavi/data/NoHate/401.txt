Now you are tasting for 8/5 what Cons taste 24/7. Get the picture ? Think you have to guts , the fortitude , the Will to remain sane , safe and sound and get out and make it under such a regime ? Doubt it , you have experinaced trouble here already in doing so. LOTS OF LOVE MAX Max , While I am sure there are " some " ( translate to FEW ) cases of this with the Cons , you will find that in most cases the staff communicate very succintly what they want , but the con " turns a deaf ear " .
