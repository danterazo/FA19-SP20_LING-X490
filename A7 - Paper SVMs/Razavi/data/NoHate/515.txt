There , I am anonymous , who cares ! - I am just legs and arms and hat in Pixley Park 200 miles up the valley who cares ! - I know not where I am going anyway I shall not run aground in autumn , evergreens asplendor all in Pixley Park who cares ! - I shall walk among the migrant lettuce-workers , man of peace , I am in autumns sinking sun , in Pixley Park It is time to no longer fight and to embrace this lonely light forgetting otiosity of spring forgetting lack and lust who cares ! - I shall sip runny vegetable soup and walk around this autumn 200 miles up the dusty valley in Pixley Park. I am just legs and arms and hatFANTASTIC. the rest of it , too. but these lines hooked me. Renay All those shalls how eerily Eliotic ! SAO
