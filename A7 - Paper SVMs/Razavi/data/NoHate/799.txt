Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work. To me with this work and Schnurers work the superconductor is too small to produce an observable change of weight. But I am not sure. And its hard to separate out the effect of the liquid nitogen fumes. I get a 2.9 % weight loss by illuminating the insides of a 0.82 m hollow aluminum sphere with 3000 watts of infrared heat. With a colander and the same power I get a 1.6 % weight loss. I have also made control runs to separage the spurious heat effects from the genuine gravity effects. Another thing : My test mass looks more like a UFO than does Podkketnovs or Schnurers test mass. Why do UFOs hover silently ? Could they be kicking heat out the bottom like my 0.82 m hemisphere does ? UFOs are touchy when a light is flashed on them. When I take a photo of my device during a test a slight change of weight occurs at the instance of the flash from the camera. Peter Fred But what is it bouyant in ? Could not anti-gravity be a form of bouyancy within the field of gravity ? If not exactly by definition at least by appearence. Of course I am not saying this is what is going on , just pointing out that you should be more clear. If this is indeed what is going on it would still be seen as a great breakthrough.
