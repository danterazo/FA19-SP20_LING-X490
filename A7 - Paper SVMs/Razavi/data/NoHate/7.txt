You need to traverse the list and ask each item ( object ) to write itself to a file stream ( fstream ) . If you have a linked list of simple data types ( int , char , etc. ) then just traverse the list and write those values into a file. operators and in order to compile this code Loading the list looks pretty much the same except you dynamically create a new listitem variable , read the value from the file stream , and adjust the pointers. ( the following code is just a simple , rather inefficient , illustration of the reloading process and it should not be considered for serious application ) Sanin Saracevic I am using a linked list that I would like to store in a file so I could reload it into memory at a later date. Does anyone know how to do this or know of any resources I could check out. Thanks Len [ about comp.lang.c + + .moderated. First time posters : do this ! ] [ about comp.lang.c + + .moderated.
