I very recently starting studying Shorin-Ryu Karate , and from what I understand it emphasizes striking and kicking , with not as much emphasis on throwing and grappling. Scott , You are spot on. The grappler/striker debate has been waged repeatedly in this NG. I reserve comment in this regard. In the Okinawan Karate systems that I am familiar with , beginner waza typically focus on block , kick , punch. The throwing , grappling , pressure points , etc are usually introduced at a more advanced level. Check with the yudansha in your dojo to see if they indeed have this advanced bunkai in their portfolio. Not all instructors have this knowledge even though it is contained within the system. Often those who do have this knowledge will introduce it later in the training. One tool that I introduce early on is change body ( dodging ) . Learning to move , get out of the way and position yourself favorably will be beneficial no matter what an aggressor throws at you. Later on , change body provides an entry for more advanced things like grappling , throwing , joint and point manipulation. You may need to be patient in your study or you may need to reconsider the dojo in which you take instruction. Ask some questions , dig for information then decide if you are in the right place.
