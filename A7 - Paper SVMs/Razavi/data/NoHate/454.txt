Kevin , Does the wife have a sister ? : Hi all , : Thanks for the support . [ snip ] : I leave it for you to decide. I hope those of you that have been pleased : with my services will continue dealing with me. I live for cycling and enjoy : all aspects of it. I have been involved in cycling for about 14 years now : from racing as a category 1 to working at several well known bike shops as a : head mechanic and manager. I am currently in North Dakota ( not my first : choice for riding ) because my wife is in medical school on a full : scholarship. We are planning to move somewhere a bit warmer fairly soon. I : hope this thread has not cut into anyones riding time. Keep the rubber side : down. : Kevin
