As one teacher who aked everyone their ethnicity/heritage commented , " You come from an ancient heritage " . End of story - I had no need to flaunt it. You are 100 % right ! Of course the opinion of an American school teacher ( we all know how qualified they are ) has much more gravity than the views of the overwhelming majority of professors/academics who claim Macedonia to be part of the Greek world ( they are all lying Hope ) . All of us by personal experience know there are teachers and there are teachers. Some deserved and deserve the praise. Others are filling space. It makes no difference if they are professors/academics or public school teachers. Its the same in any profession no matter the location , too.Some excel , others flounder. All of us know of the connection in re : to the history of the Macedonians with the Greeks. All of us do not see it the same way. Its only later when certain forces reared their ugly heads did all of this become vital. ? ? ? Well , yes , there was a time when it was not important to defend my Macedonian heritage nor is it important anywhere else other than this medium to have to do it now and that is even in the company of the Greeks I happen to know. HRA PS Not too long ago , I read in a book that the phalanx was strictly a Macedonian military tactic and worked only with the Macedonians long swords in it. It also stated that the Greeks were unable to be an integral part of it due to their having short swords. I did submit this to the ng with the citation. No , I do not have it available now. Maybe its in the archives here. Costas LONG LIVE THE SCHOOL TEACHER !
