] ] [ quoting Descartes ] ] ] While I wanted to think everything false , it must necessarily be ] that I who thought was something ; and remarking that this truth , _I ] think , therefore I am_ , was so solid and so certain that all the most ] extravigant suppositions of the skeptics were incapable of upsetting ] it , I judged that I could receive it without scruple as the first ] principle of the philosophy that I sought. " ] ] " Thought exists. Thought implies thinker. Therefore thinker exists. " ] ] That sounds to me exactly like one of those syllogisms Mati ] was talking about. It does. However , that is not Descartes argument. Descartes is not saying " thinker exists. " Rather , he says " I think. " So ? he is convinced that some thinking is being done by something he calls " I " . He fails to define his terms. Does he think I is the only thinker ? If not , does I think only those thoughts which I is aware of ? Are all thoughts " I " is aware of , thought by " I " . No ? Yes ? Descartes seems to have some way he thinks he can tell. He has to , since if he cant , he cant tell from a thought he becomes aware of who is thinking it , if anyone. Much less himself. And if he thinks all thinking he is aware of is done by himself , he mustve been really egotistical to talk to. ] Now I previous commented that that it is pretty hard to argue with ] a central point there , that thinking exists , or " there are thoughts. " That is not the central point. Can you read ? Can you think ? How do you know YOU exist ? Must be getting quite scary. ] Sure there are thoughts. We define thoughts as a category by making ] reference to themselves. The tough part is in proving that thoughts ] require a thinker. ] ] Exactly. Exactly wrong. We await your proof .
