Not wanting to be forever purchasing AA batteries to power my Nexstar , I went to Radio Shack to see what I could find. I use the Prestone battery pack to power my CG-5 and Kendrick dew heater. It has a cigarette lighter built into it as well as booster cables for jumping a car. It charges up overnight. it is a little expensive ( around $ 110 US ) but I find it is a handy thing to havefor astronomy or just general use. The other day my wifes car needed a boost so I was able to boost it with the battery , recharge it and go out observing that night and use it. Todd Before you buy .
