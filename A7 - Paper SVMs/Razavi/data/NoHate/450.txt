Leo Sgouros a é crit dans le message Thats because " O Canada " has no tune of its own. It is the only existing parasitic national anthem. It commonly steals the tune from " O Christmas Tree " , and occasionally from " Copacabana " . HTH. I thought it was Oh Carolyne by Cheap Trick I think you are confuing that song with " O Caroline " by Matching Mole , or possibly " Caroline No " by Soft Trick. " Imagine if Adolf Hitler were allowed into art school AND given YES albums to listen to ? Think about what would have happened if Fidel Castro were allowed to play baseball AND listen to YES albums. I firmly believe the world would be a different place today ! " - Dave Rheault shares some deep thoughts about Yes. No I think you really thought that I thought it was Sweet Caroline,by that weird guy. Be honest now. Isnt it Oh Carolina by Shaggy ?
