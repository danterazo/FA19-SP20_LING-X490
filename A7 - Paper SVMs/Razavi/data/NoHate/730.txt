Hookdll.dll in the original name for ICQs icqhook.dll. Have you deleted icqhook.dll form your ICQ folder by mistake ? If youve uninstalled ICQ make sure the Icon is removed from your Start up folder/ Pity the man who knows everything , for he can never learn anything. I am missing file. Everytime I open my computer it says that I have a missing DLL.HOOKDLL.DLL and I dont know what this is or how to replace it. Can you help me ? If it is in a program , would I replace the entire program or can I simply download the file from somewhere ? Any help is greatly appreciated ! Thanks ! Trish Posted via CNET Help.com
