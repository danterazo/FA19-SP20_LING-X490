it is not part of the standard as of f95. Youll have to RTFM , looking for something like getarg ( ) , iargc ( ) , etc. In the f2k standard , there is a way , but dont expect f2k compilers for a few years. In case his RTFM browse turns up dry , and he cant wait til 2009 , there is a trick for OSs that support scripts with arguments. In DOS , write a batch file like : echo % 1 tempargs echo % 2 tempargs echo % 3 tempargs myprog Have your program " myprog " read file tempargs. Run everything via the batch file. A script for Unix should be pretty similar ; I just dont have the syntax in my head. Ken Plotkin
