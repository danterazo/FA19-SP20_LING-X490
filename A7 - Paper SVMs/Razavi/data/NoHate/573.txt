I train in TKD , but as I have balance problems due to a mild disability , I do not kick well. One of the instructors is teaching me bo-staff , jo , and hanbo to make up for my lack of kicks. I often carry a walking stick and have found the jo techniques to be very effective with it. But as TKD isnt really weapons oriented , my training is probably slightly unusual. I am not reliant upon my cane , so I may not be the best example .
