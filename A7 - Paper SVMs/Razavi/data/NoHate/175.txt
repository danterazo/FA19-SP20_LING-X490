There was no year zero. The first 1000 years ended at the end of 1000 , the second at the end of 2000. did the 60s start in 1960 ? did the 90s start in 1990 ? did the second decade start in 10 ? - ofcourse. the first decade had only 9 years. the first millenium had only 999 years. but , as a jewish friend of mine pointed out , what the big deal- this is really the year 5thousand something ( forgot exact date ) , the second millenium started a long ime ago .
