We also have the problem of defining " economist " the problem I was suggesting when I pointed out that there were creationists who , in terms of academic credentials , qualified as biologists. It doesnt follow that there is serious controversy within biology over creation vs evolution. There are lots of people who would describe themselves as economists who I wouldnt describe as real economists , and who I suspect Paul Krugman , whose politics are rather different from mine , wouldnt describe as real economists either. The reason is not that they disagree with meEarl Thompson and Abba Lerner disagreed with me , and certainly were ( in Earls case , still is ) economists. The reason is that they either could not get a reasonably good grade on a price theory exami.e. do not understand the fundamentals of economic theoryor could get it only by giving answers they didnt believei.e. dont agree with the fundamentals of economic theory. They are " economists " in the sense of " people who are hired to do In your opinion , by the definition above , is John Kenneth Galbraith a " real economist ? " Robert Reich ? Paul Samuelson ?
