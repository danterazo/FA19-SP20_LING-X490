They said the Macedonians are not Hellenes. Todays Greeks claim that the ancient Macedonians were Greek. Should we listen to todays Greek propagandists telling us what happened 2500 years ago , or should we accept the viewpoint of the ancient Hellenes who clearly stated that the Macedonians were not Hellenes ? No , even today you can not believe the Greeks. When the Greeks occupied Aegean Macedonia in 1913 , they began to change peoples names , place names and suppressed the Macedonian language in 1936. They did this to make the Macedonian people look like they are Greek , but they will never accomplish this. The Macedonians can never be changed into something else. They will always be Macedonians ! Philips tomb was found in Macedonian territory not in Sparta. Yet Greece claims that Philip was a Greek king. What does that tell you about Greek lies ? Ilinden
