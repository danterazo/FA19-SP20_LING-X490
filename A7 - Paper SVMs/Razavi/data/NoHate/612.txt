I have installed StarOffice and want to give it a try. But it doesnt convert my Lotus WordPro files ( it just launches WordPro when I try to open them. ) Whats the best way to get them in ? Should I " save as MSWord " from Wordpro ? Or RTF ? Or AmiPro ? Or is it supposed to be able to convert them directly ? John Abraham , M.Sc. P.Eng. T.J. Modelling Ltd.
