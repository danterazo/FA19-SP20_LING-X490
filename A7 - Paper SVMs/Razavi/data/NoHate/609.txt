I have tried Orthotricyclen and Nelova , both of which made me to gain weight , ( plus lowered my libido ) . I was using herbal diuretics , so edema is not the cause. Now the doctor gave me Levlite ( lower dose of estrogen ) to try. I read somewhere that levonorgestrel ( the progesterone in Levlite ) is even worse. Is this true ? Does anybody know which combination pill causes the least chance of weight gain ? Ironically , when I actually was pregnant , I lost weight ! Thanks for any suggestions Before you buy .
