I am the poor unfortunate wretch who started this thread a few days ago. I would like to comment on the responses it has generated so far. Conover , Oct. 14 : I sit corrected. I should have said that the slope was everywhere positive , rather than saying that the function was monotonic. Will everyone please drop the argument about monotonicity ? it is irrelevant. Yes , I know that the impedance function is entirely represented by its zeros and poles. Oddly enough , no one has mentioned that the zeros and poles are interlaced along the real omega axis. Or that the impedance function is always odd in omega. Thats true , isnt it , Harry ? Green , Oct. 14 : I am talking about purely reactive networks. So there is no energy absorption. Nothing has been said about maxima , because there are no maxima. Herring , Oct. 14 : You say that reactance is zero at resonance. Thats true for a series resonant LC circuit. A parallel resonant LC circuit has infinite reactance at resonance. I am not interested in circuits containing 2 elements. I am interested in circuits of arbitrary complexity containing only pure reactances. Meron , Oct. 14 : Yes , tan ( x ) is an example of a function that has positive slope everywhere. It passes through infinity every once in a while , and is a simple example of the kind of function I am talking about. Conover , Oct. 15 : Right on. Your disdain is admirable. Houghton , Oct. 15 : Phase is of very little interest in situations where the functions are pure imaginary , as they are when there is no resistance. The phase is either 90 or 270 degrees , nothing else. ( Well , OK , it is indeterminate when the resistance and reactance are both zero. ) Meron , Oct. 15 : You are right again , but you are getting off the subject , which was Fosters Theorem .
