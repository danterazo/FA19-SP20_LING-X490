They say he practised hard yesterday and he has ( to my knowledge ) not stated that he is injured ( although this in itself doesnt mean much ) . Does this mean something or nothing ? I am normally a big naysayer when it comes to conspiracy theories , but this series of events does sound highly suspicious , especially with Snow practicing at full speed the day before he gets put on the injured list. I would not be at all surprised to see Snow land in Boston or Long Island before long , provided Sinden or Milbury can dump their high salaried goalies to someone else. Even if Snow gets dumped to points east , I dont see either Dafoe or Potvin arriving here. ( Potvin is a slight possibility forget Dafoe. ) I would not be at all surprised to see Burke dump Snow for some youth or draft picks , and just tough out the year with Legace and Weekes. The Canucks are at least a year or two away from contending , and they can address their goaltending needs at that time if need be. In the meantime , Snow is a highly disposable asset who helps them pay off contract buyout for " The Key " , money for Jovo and Aucoin , etc .
