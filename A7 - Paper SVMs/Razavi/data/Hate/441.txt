belched forth this foul matter from their bowels : does anybody remember what song was playing in the background as the kid leaves the elevator after filling Bill Murrays room with bees ? it is a badass song set to a badass scene filmed in slow-motion as Max steps out of the elevator. Is it the Who ? The Kinks ? I havent seen the movie but I think you may be thinking of The Creation doing Making Time. Maybe ? Actually , the Creation song is in the beginning of the movie. The song he is talking about is the Who doing " A Quick One. " TEX " Eigenlijk houd ik helemaal niet van punkmuziek " Sjoerd Goslinga
