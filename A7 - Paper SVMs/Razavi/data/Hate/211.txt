One aspect of the groundfighting vs. standup fighting argument which is often overlooked is energy expenditure , and how this differs in each realm. One of the things that a groundfighter knows which stand-up fighters or untrained people dont realize is the fact that it is very exhausting to fight on the ground against a person who knows position maintenance. I know wat you mean , my schools ground-grappling included some monkey stuff that focuses on wearing out your opponent. Works pretty well until the eye gouges start. What the fuck do stupid smelly monkeys know about grappling ? Why are you emulating animals ?
