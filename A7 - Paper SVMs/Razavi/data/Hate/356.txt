I am in no position to verify or refute Rummels figures ( Otto Pohl has some interesting views on that subject if he is around ) but I would condemn democide from whatever source. David I am not sure that my views are that interesting , but Rummels figures for the USSR certainly exceed most estimates of Soviet excess death under Stalin. Currently most estimates converge around 20 million. The Soviet documentary records regarding executions , deaths in corrective labor camps , corrective labor colonies , prisons , special settlements , POW camps , etc. is much more extencsive than any statistical documents that exist for deaths caused by the Nazis. These recorded deaths in the Soviet records exceed three and a half million deaths in OGPU-NKVD-MVD custody. In terms of genocide , the Stalinist deportation of North Caucasians destroyed a percentage of the total population of the Karachais , Chechens , Ingush and Balkars almost equal to total world Jewish losses during World War II. Yet according to the great hero of " anti- revisionists " Deborah Lipstadt , " In contrast , no citizen of the Soviet Union assumed that deportation and death were inevitable consequences of his or her ethnic origins. " Denying the Holocaust ( p. 212 ) . Her denial of this particular crime against humanity proves that " anti- revisionists " are not at all interested in truth or concerned about genocide denial. They are concerned with a political agenda of which uses the " uniqueness " of the Holocaust as a shield to dismiss other state crimes as morally insignificant. J. Otto Pohl Before you buy .
