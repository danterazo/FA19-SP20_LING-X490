Once youve set your latitude with Polaris , you should be able to achieve well below 25/hour drift from a good motor drive. I routinely get 15-18 [ or better ! ] of drift per hour - fine for visual use. Darren. Hi Animator , Further to your recent posting re : Finding North. I thought I would share with you my experience. I have been observing for just over two months now - with almost 1 month of cloud : - ( using a 4.5 " ( 114mm ! ) Newtonian , I do not posses a compass. How do I polar align I hear you ask ? I take a bloody good guess ! I then home in by trial and error. This is exactly how I first polar aligned on my very first viewing night and I still do. My guesses appear to be getting better with time may I add ! At home , I have placed pegs in the garden , either side of my dark viewing spot. I am sorry , but this just seamed obvious to me at the time , no hard thinking required. P.S. Tonight was my first night out in almost a month ! Jupiter and Saturn looked great , I say Pleiades for the first time and WOW ! My collation attempts a month ago really have improved the results obtained. More Clear Skies !
