Vidar the complascent , OK ! Looks like at least 1 person addressed every issue you have thus far addressed to this motley ng in the last month. For the answer to your current issue consult deja.com for the perenial alwaysontopSM thingy aka setwinpos mojo Bye , Neila I was surprised noone ansewered. Newsgroups are usually so effective if you want to learn something fast. This time it was trial and error. I now hope someone could help me with another problem. I have a 1024768 fullscreen frame and one that a picture in the back. Text scrolls and zooms smoothly on top. Now I need to start a movie , but it is behind all of it. It starts and sound comes thru , but no picture. How do I get it in front ? This is Direct Draw 7 , so it is not a focus problem. Can I set priorities on the movie frame to go in front of everything ? Or if not , how to clip it to the background screen ?
