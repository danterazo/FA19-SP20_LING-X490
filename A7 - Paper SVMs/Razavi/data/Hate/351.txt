I do not believe that God can be detected , observed or analyzed at this time , nor do I believe that at this time science can disprove his ( its ) existence. The problem with religions is that they project human aspects on to the divine entity. It is a concoction of insanity , hallucination , hypocrisy and fear. Getting even with divinity for the alleged creation and bringing us into a torturous life. Thusly putting divinity in the lap of a virgin , torturing , crucifying and killing then resurrecting and asking for salvation. Sexual frustration as well is deeply rooted in religions. Making " GOD " a male entity is sexual projection from both sexes not from males only. Eve eats from the forbidden tree but " God " stays silent , blind and deaf. Yet when she gives Adam to eat and he does , Pops up the GOD for challenge , male to male. Adam defied Gods will. So , as far as proving the fallacy of religions at any time , is very easy. You are skeptic about disproving the fact of divinity in the primordial sense. Here I have to agree because the basis of consciousness and self awareness of life must have its roots in the primordial fabric from which we are made into the zenith of complexity. So , such a divinity is inseparable from beingness but does not interfere like complex beings except through complex beings. We are the Gods that we describe and we do exist , hence the conflict is only conceptual. That is why the debate never ends while you argue with those drunk with the above described concoction. Cheers EL I am the most ignorant , by touching the unknown. A humble science monk , whose brain is made of stone. Yet , wisdom is my kingdom and knowledge my throne. Before you buy. The personification of a force Before you buy .
