" Polar " you are a one ! A bit off the mark , a pretender to the faith whose prayer cloth you use as disguise wrapping it around a liar ! A meddler ! A pryer ! A schrier ! A busybody ! A would-be attention-grabbing fool. And you are no yeshiva-bucher , too ! But keep on writing ! With each post you expose more of your miserable crappy excuse for a self. As long as you dont mind , I dont mind. The whip for your excoriation thirsts. neon , m .
