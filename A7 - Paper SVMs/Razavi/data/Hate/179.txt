Someone in this newsgroup was wondering what was meant by Micro vs. Macro evolution. Micro evolution is when a creature adapts to it is envionment genetically. This happens all the time. We have definate proof for it. Anyone denying it is a moron. Macro evolution is when a creature ceases to be able to breed with similar creatures and so becomes a separate creature. Macro Evolution is decried as false and unscientific by protestant evangelists. Unfortunetly , the strength of their protests reduces their credibility. Come on , arent they the ones who proposed that man was made from dust ? Actually , they have a rather clever ( if ultimatly metaphysical ) way of running around Macro. You show them an instance of speciation ( a new species splitting of from an old ) and they say " But it is STILL an X " . A new species of beetle is still a beetle. A new species of corn is still corn. They want to see changes on a much higher level.Elephants to cows or some such. Any speciation they claim is still in the same " kind " and is thus , micro-evolution. Frank Bartunek spam blocking in effect. To reply remove " not " When someone is saved from certain death by a strange concatenation of circumstances , they say its a miracle. But of course if someone is killed by a freak chain of events - that must also be a miracle. Just because it isnt nice doesnt mean its not miraculous. Terry Pratchett " Interesting Times "
