Someone stated that I was spamming No. Spamming is off-topic solicitation. If you were selling bootleg Viagra , get-rich schemes , or imported lingerie from China , that would be spamming. I have no problem with CB radios being advertised for sale in a CB newsgroup. Note : this address does not accept unsolicited e-mail. Please contain all discussion regarding USENET posts to the appropriate newsgroup thread .
