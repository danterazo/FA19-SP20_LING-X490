Warning : This discussion of New World prehistory and related issues has taken on a religious colorationanyone entering the thread at this point please identify yourself by religion ( or lack thereof ) so that everything is above board ! I guess Doug isnt talking about the asinine , easily-disproved beliefs about what happened in the Americas ca. 2kya. And what beliefs are these exactly ? see arlier comments about mormon archaeology , and the trsutworthiness of sources investigating data which conflicts with deply-held beleifs. Since most Americanist linguistics obviously have " deply " held " beleifs " about the unprovability of any relationship between American Indian languages and Old World languages , it is just as fair to dispute how the evidence collides with their " beleifs " as it is to dispute mine. Assuming you get straight what mine are , of course. more would be off-topic. How could evidence for what happened in Mesoamerica 2kya be off topic ? So maybe it is the bit about a dark skin being a sign of Gods disfavour ? Who believes this exactly ? Please note : Doung said " racist background " . Yes , and I am still waiting for his response. ( Not even I would refer to him as " Doung " ! ; Beleif today is antoher question. No , it is not , since you are using my beliefsor rather some beliefs that you think I holdto decide that I am unworthy to post here. mormon history is , again , off-topic here , but if you truly dont see the racist background to Mormonism , you only re-affirm Dougs comment. The burden of proof is on you to prove that Mormonism has a " racist background. " So far in this thread I have seen no evidence of this. I will say no more. Try not toat least till you know what you are talking about. R. Ben Madison
