Hello Cbradeeo : I am sorry , I missed the part about helping people out getting their ham license , and by making ham radio very attractive by being friendly ! ? This is my exact point. Ham radio really shoots itself in the foot by being snotty and unfriendly. Pity. Jay in the Mojave There are literally hundreds of posts old and new. Dont shoot the messenger because you dont like the message. And yes , Cbers are getting busted week in and week out. Will you be next ? postscript to trollenforcer : knowbody ( sic ) is spelled like thisnobodyand your ( sic ) is spelled like this.you are. Thanks for all the positive responses from the rest of you that want to see the sewer hole called " CB " cleaned up again !
