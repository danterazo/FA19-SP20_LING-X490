Stupid ? I dont think so. Maybe lazy for not buying a basic book on 35mm photography. But they have a right to participate and ask questions. Maybe you are the stupid one for letting those questions get to you. You can always use a filter. i never heard so many dumb questions as in this group. why dont all the beginners go to AOL with the rest of the newbees and give this group a breakbetter yet.go spend some time on ebay and let some of the crooks there taake your money so you wont be able to afford to come back here next month .
