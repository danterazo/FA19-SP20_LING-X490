The United States Memorial Holocaust " Museum " Yup , thats right. Moran recommends to all deniers that they put the word " museum " in quote marks. We all have an idea of real museums. In fact we might as well put " United States " in quote marks since we all know what it is all about. Yeaj , for one thing , it is about Freedom of Speech and Religion , which really burns Morons ass. Sara = Phillips Oh , you really think the Holocaust Museum is about Freedom of Speech and Religion and not about Jewish power - yes ? There is a way we can put your theory to the test. Tell you what you do. Start a nationwide campaign to have erected in our nations capital ( and as close as possible to the present Holocaust Museum ) a similar museum to honor the victims of Stalin Ukrainian Holocaust of 1929-33. Try it and see how far you get. = Mr. Phillips needs to learn a little reading comprehension. I said the UNITED STATES stands for Freedom of Speech and Religion. Sara Phillips It is a well-known debating tactic of the Jewish liberal to impute to a non-concurring opponent either badly deficient education or badly deficient cognitive faculties. one or the other must be the case.
