[ snip ] Sorry , Albert Einstein , without his wife would not know where his pad was to write his dream , what his is famous for : ) . You are delving into this mans personal life. Didnt his findings require some organization of his ideas ? His finding were based on his hobby , I said earlier he arrived at it in a dream. Why is it that kooks always seize on poor old Albert Einstein and try to claim him as their own ? at it , however , I can not believe that it was all the product of a dream there is a heck of a lot of hard work there. Are you talking about personal life only or presonal and professional life ? A little research on Alexander Graham Bell would also support CFAs comments. Thomas , define " organized. " Do you mean only in terms of neatness and housekeeping ? Dont intellectual ideas require organization in order to make an impact ? In the personal life of a Pisces your sure to find dis-order , does it carry over to their work ? Some on occassion , many always. The medical profession depends on organization and accuracy : doctors and nurses adhere to very high standards of organization. If your definition of a Pisces lacking organization is true , then is it also true that there are no organized doctors and nurses who are Pisceans ? Or do some break this mold ? Is this a firm definition or is it a fluid dynamic ? This whole discussion is based on a Sun Sign and a general consideration of the sign. Firm definition : 70 % of Pisces fit the mold , and 30 % dont. Now in a democracy ( free thinking ) the Majority rule : ) . Ooops. There goes that old symbolism and archetype excuse , right out the window. 70 % of Pisces are disorganized ? Thats a pretty specific statement. Where is the study and the data to back that up ? What percentage of other signs are disorganized ? PZ Myers
