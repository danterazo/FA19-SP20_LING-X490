OK , could be dangerous , all women are in certain sense : . No , seriously this is supposed to be a discussion forum and everyone should be open to discussion and discussion means be factual , not just throwing words around. If someones trying to be dangerous , problem stays with him. Thnx anyway. smi Also thanks to those few of you who abandantly supported the things they said with facts , Galinas facts are always lies. I had in mind your facts , buddy , not hers. She didnt provide any. But she was not cursing around , too. OK , sorry , but that woman is dangerous. She gives the apparancy of niceness then sticks the knife in and twists. Not content with that , she sticks her arm in and pulls out the entrails. I am NOT joking. She is evil. from : Spirit Of The Real Makedon ( using Junes e-mail to communicate to you ) ! The heart of Macedonia was always Greek Before you buy .
