CarlD does not use his real name , however he is simple enough to trace. The man posts to the Internet religiously. Subjective. He lives in a small town in Texas. Wrong. He keeps gold and silver stashed away. Gold jewelry and silver coins in addition to other assets. He is a gun nut and an explosives nut who thinks the world is going to end in chaos at any moment. " gun nut " is a common term used by leftist fuckheads to deride any gun owner. Yes , I own guns. Not as many as some folks. " explosives nut " is just plain bullshit. I have advised people on how NOT to blow their hands off if they are gon na mess with that stuff. I dont recommend it. There is hardly a facet of " Carlds " life that he has not posted publically , somewhere , somehow. Sure , right. Men like CarlD are problems about to happen. You are an idiot. They are paranoid. They are delusional. They make serious mistakes they can not rectify. Sounds like you are describing yourself. ( remainder of idiocy snipped )
