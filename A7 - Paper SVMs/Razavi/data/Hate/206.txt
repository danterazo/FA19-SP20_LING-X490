Please dont make the mistake that all amateur radio operators are ARRL members or even supportive of the Leagues policies. A growing number are not. Myself included. i have another posted response in here somewhere , if you look around , to something that this guy said where he sounds like an ARRL salesman and refered to him as " hams like you " meaning him. you and i dont agree on a lot of things here but i am trying to be more careful of the was i classify the difference between hams like you and ASSHOLE HAMS like HIM. jeff
