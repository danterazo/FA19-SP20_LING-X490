As Rich commented , you are getting more and more difficult to believe. We all make mistakes - both as beginners and advanced amateurs. We are not all quite as hopeless are you are starting to appear. Well Jeepers , I just feel so stupid now. Hey , I have got an idea , how about the next time someone asks a question like how do i find north if I dont have a compass and cant see Polaris we do something like answer the question , instead of poking fun , calling names and assuming that everyone in the universe is as well educated in the ins-and-and outs of astronomy as we are ? The whole scenario of forgetting my compass and being nowhere with obvious reference points was only brought up because people started asking me why I didnt just go buy a compass. I ask a question that some people seem to think is so simple and obvious that it shouldnt have been asked at all. If it is so simple , why all the added attractions ? Why not answer the question and get on with life ? The posts that say go buy a compass as an answer to the question what if I cant buy a compass are , as stated , totally redundant. Sure , the first couple of posts that said that had their humorous undercoatings , and I can enjoy a good joke as much as anyone else. But when someone goes to the extent of saying I am stupid , unbelievable and/or hopeless - that takes the joke a little too far. If you dont know the answer , dont participate. If you do know it , answer the question. This isnt rocket science , after all. Oh , wait , I guess it is. JB
