Should definitely be on the list of the most important persons of the 20th century. By the way has anyone noticed that A&E is doing a " People of the Millenium " series based on the 100 most important people of the past 1,000 years ? they have been giving hints as to who is on it. Diana , Princess of Wales is on it ! Thats enough to make me wonder if they are nuts already. Damn it , Ellsworth ! Stop writing things I agree with ! I am gon na buy a cross-country round trip ticket just to come back East and smack you ! ( Fake trash talk mode off. ) Diana is one of the 100 most important people of the last 20 years. Maybe. I wonder how many folks they are going to put on the list whose most important work is at least 100 years old ? here is ten I think cant miss , and there are of course many more. Shakespeare , Darwin , Jefferson , Elizabeth I , Henry VIII , Da Vinci , Michelangelo , Bach , Beethoven , Mozart. MattH Jefferson ? Isnt he currently in the revisionist doghouse ?
