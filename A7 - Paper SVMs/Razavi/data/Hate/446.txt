As far as giving away ideas and such , thats what sell out do , theives also , when they put on the act of giving away that which is not their work as though it is. Which can put other at risk. Think about it and maybe get back to the subject. The people doing the giving away are the ones with the ideas , hoping they will find their way into code or products of someone who knows how to do those things. If I have an idea and want to pass that to olaf or dave and they elect to use it , I send them a letter of thanks for taking my idea and turning it into something useful. There is no thievery there !
