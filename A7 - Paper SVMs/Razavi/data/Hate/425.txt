Communism has slaughtered over 200 million people this century and currently enslaves about a quarter of mankind. Evidence for your 200 million ? Stalin did in 20 to 40 million. I dont have a count on Mao but 160 million sounds a bit high. Sir , I dealt with the same question some months ago when Deppity Bob made the same point. Perhaps youll forgive me for reposting my response to him. It was : Subject : Re : no bullshit begin repost Please take a look at : Want to see David disappear really fast ? Watch. Hey , Dave ! Rummel also says that the Nazis killed more than 20 million people including 5.2 million Jews : Do you consider his figures accurate ? Or do you only have tears for the victims of Communism ? I am in no position to verify or refute Rummels figures ( Otto Pohl has some interesting views on that subject if he is around ) but I would condemn democide from whatever source. If you are also in no position to verify or refute Rummels figures , why do you find his figures on Communist murder worthy of comment but not his figures on Nazi murder ? Pohls figure , by the way , is 4.8 million. You wont get much help there. at University of Alberta Multi pertransibunt & augebitur scientia " Nizkooks are not members of homosapiens.
