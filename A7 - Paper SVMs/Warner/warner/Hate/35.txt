Thanks to some courageous non-Zionist Jewish rabbis we have here the record of Zionist collaboration with Nazism and the Holocaust. The racist and sacrificial politics of Zionism come right out and bite you in this quotation and provide all the justification Jewish people need to publicly denounce the Zionist leadership and its supremacist ideology. My people were sacrificed too , in Russian pogroms and German concentration camps. I have the right to speak on this matter. I have the right to examine and to accurately reveal history , and the responsibility to do so .
