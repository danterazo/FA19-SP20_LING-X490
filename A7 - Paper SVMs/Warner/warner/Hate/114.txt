` The Hollywood Jews would cope through " a sustained attempt to live a fiction , and to cast its spell over the minds of others. " What is amazing is the extent to which they succeeded in promulgating this fiction throughout the world. By making a " shadow " America , one which idealized every old glorifying bromide about the country , the Hollywood Jews created a powerful cluster of images and ideas -- so powerful that , in a sense , they colonized the American imagination. No one could think about this country without thinking about the movies. As a result , the paradox -- that the movies were quintessentially American while the men who made them were not -- doubled back on itself. Ultimately , American values came to be defined largely by the movies the Jews made. Ultimately , by creating their idealized America on the screen , the Jews reinvented the country in the image of their fiction. '
