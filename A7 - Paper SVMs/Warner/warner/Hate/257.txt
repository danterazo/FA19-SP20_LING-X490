6. Thank you Mr. Eng for expressing what most folks secretly agree with . It 's important to understand the thinking of other races and ethnicities . I am a Caucasian/European. Maybe as a Caucasian I too can now write " Why I hate Blacks. " Or " Why I hate Israelis " , boy do I hate them ! Funny , I do n't hate Asians. But what is important here is that groups understand and hear why they are disliked by other groups. Maybe it will open all of our eyes !
