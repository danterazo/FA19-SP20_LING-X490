The Newhouse media empire provides an example of more than the lack of real competition among America 's daily newspapers : it also illustrates the insatiable appetite Jews have shown for all the organs of opinion control on which they could fasten their grip. The Newhouses own 31 daily newspapers , including several large and important ones , such as the Cleveland Plain Dealer , the Newark Star-Ledger , and the New Orleans Times-Picayune ; Newhouse Broadcasting , consisting of television stations and cable operations ; the Sunday supplement Parade , with a circulation of more than 35 million copies per week ; some two dozen major magazines , including The New Yorker , Vogue , Wired , Glamour , Vanity Fair , Bride 's , Gentlemen 's Quarterly , Self , House & Garden , and all the other magazines of the wholly-owned Conde Nast group. The staffing of the magazines is , as you might expect , quite Kosher. Parade can serve as an example : Its publisher is Randy Siegel , its editor and senior vice president is Lee Kravitz , its creative director is Ira Yoffe , its science editor is David H. Levy , and its health editor is Dr. Isadore Rosenfeld .
