The Negro was originally viewed as a docile being who would easily succumb to a master 's orders - unlike the former " indentured servants or white slaves " who would not tolerate anything but self rule. And in small numbers , the Negro did adjust well to plantation life. The Negro is often described as having a " pack " mentality. Negroes do not start becoming unruly until their population grows in proportion to whites .
