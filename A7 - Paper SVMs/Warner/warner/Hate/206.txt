This Jewish media empire was founded by the late Samuel Newhouse , an immigrant from Russia. When he died in 1979 at the age of 84 , he bequeathed media holdings worth an estimated $ 1.3 billion to his two sons , Samuel and Donald. With a number of further acquisitions , the net worth of Advance Publications has grown to more than $ 9 billion today . The gobbling up of so many newspapers by the Newhouse family was facilitated by newspapers ' revenue structure. Newspapers , to a large degree , are not supported by their subscribers but by their advertisers . It is advertising revenue * not the small change collected from a newspaper 's readers * that largely pays the editor 's salary and yields the owner 's profit. Whenever the large advertisers in a city choose to favor one newspaper over another with their business , the favored newspaper will flourish while its competitor dies. Since the beginning of the last century , when Jewish mercantile power in America became a dominant economic force , there has been a steady rise in the number of American newspapers in Jewish hands , accompanied by a steady decline in the number of competing Gentile newspapers * to some extent a result of selective advertising policies by Jewish merchants .
