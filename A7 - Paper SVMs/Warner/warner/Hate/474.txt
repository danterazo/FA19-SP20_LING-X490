It was the Summer of 1968 and a nigger showed up at the Pearly Gates . Peter comes out and says , " Uh , is there something I can do for you ? I mean , we do n't let niggers in here. " " I know , " said the nigger , " It 's just that , I am from Alabama , and I grew up around White folks , and I like White folks , and I even married a White woman , so I thought maybe I could get in. " Peter said , " Wait , you say you married a White woman in Alabama ? When the hell was this ? " The nigger looks at his watch and says , " Oh , about 10 minutes ago. "
