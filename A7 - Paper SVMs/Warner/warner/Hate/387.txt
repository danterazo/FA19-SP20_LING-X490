The Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reports : " The Jerusalem prosecutor 's office summoned Rabbi Mordechai ( Moti ) Elon to a pre-indictment hearing on Thursday. The prosecutor 's office is considering putting Elon on trial for committing sexual offenses against two minors during 2003 and 2005 . In late January Channel 10 reported that the prosecutor 's office recommended that Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein indict Rabbi Elon for forcibly committing sexual offenses against the two minors. " The " offenses " include forcible rape of a number of young boys. In case you might think this is an isolated incident , a recent news article reports that former rabbi Edward Schlaeger was found with two compact discs loaded with child pornography. Child porn laws are one of the few remaining morality laws that are enforced in this country. Can you imagine any Gentile getting found with two CDs of kiddie porn and not going to prison ? Does anyone seriously think that if this character were a Christian minister or a Catholic priest ( especially the latter ) he would n't have been crucified in the media on prime time ? And whatever happened to that rabbi who was successfully entrapped by " To Catch A Predator " on television , coming into a house expecting to have sex with a child ? That case seems to have dropped right off the radar. ( more... )
