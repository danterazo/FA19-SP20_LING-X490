I tell you that I am not following the Jew : I am following the Incarnate Revelation of The Most High. Before you ask me , Is Jesus Christ a Jew ? I ask you this question : Is Yahweh a Jew ? We have Jesus ' own words in Matt . 23 : 33 in which He turned and told the Jews that they are serpents and a generation of vipers. He was not talking about the symbol of Lucifer 's kingdom. He said they are Lucifer 's descendants. I want to emphasize the fact that one of the first things that Jesus did in that conversation was to deny any family relationship. ( This is also one of the important records of the book of John. ) He denied any relationship with them , and in the instance when they were creating great pressures upon Him , Jesus made this statement : " I am of My Father , and you are of your father. " Therefore , I want to point out something that is most significant concerning Christ. First , let us go to Isaiah 7 : 14 , and read what it says about His birth. " Therefore Yahweh Himself the Eternal One shall give you a sign : Behold , a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son , and shall call His Name Immanuel " ( which is " Yahweh with us " ) .
