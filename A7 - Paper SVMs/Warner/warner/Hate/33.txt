From their experience with rebellious Irish slaves , Dutch Jews would eventually be instrumental in the switch from White to Black slavery in the British West Indies. Blacks were more docile and more profitable for the Jews. Gradually a shift occurred. However , Through out the 17th and 18th century , the tobacco , sugar and cotton colonies maintained a sizable white slave population. Negro slaves simply cost too much to import and purchase. Whites were cheaper ( castoffs from Britain ) and more expendable .
