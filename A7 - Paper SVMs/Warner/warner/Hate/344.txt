I have been living in Shanghai since September 2010. I work for a German company but unfortunately there is no German in my team. I 'm Asian growing up in a western country. After working together with so-called well educated Chinese colleagues for about 9 months I must say that Chinese people ( eventhough well-educated ) are sooo unorganized , hasty and panic all the time .
