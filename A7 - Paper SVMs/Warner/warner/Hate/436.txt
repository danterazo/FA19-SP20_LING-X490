It is all so saddening , to see the supposed " Peace Movement " unable to discuss Jewish Supremacism. Tikkun should be taking the lead in exposing it from its historic Talmudic origins to its present neconservative and Likud Party basis. Supremacism is hateful , as it generates murderous policy and is anti-human. You know this , so why do you protest when I discuss it ? The ADL is quick to denounce White Supremacism and Muslim Fundamentalism , but why do they deny the record of Jewish Supremacism ? It is dangerous hypocrisy .
