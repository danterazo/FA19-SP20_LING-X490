The fact is , you were n't invited here yet are anyhow here b ! tching and complaining about how Whites and Blacks treat you in their country. One poster commented on so-called ` White Privilege'. Affirmative Action was established to level the field so the argument does n't hold water. Let 's suppose that it did though. Why should n't those who established this nation , the institutions of this nation , her laws , infrastructure etc.. , and still the numerical majority by far , be permitted to assist their posterity ? Would n't this be called " Asian Privilege ' in China , N. Korea , S. Korea , Japan and other parts of Asia ? None of you apparently are too concerned with that. The hypocrisy abounds does n't it ?
