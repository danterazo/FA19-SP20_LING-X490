After the Holocaust began in 1942 , Eichmann dealt regularly with Dr . Rudolf Kastner , a Hungarian Jew , whom he considered a " fanatical Zionist. " Kastner was later assassinated in Israel as a Nazi collaborator. At issue then , however , was the bargaining over the eventual fate of Hungary 's Jews , who were slated for liquidation in the Nazi-run death camps. Eichmann said this about Kastner , the Zionist representative , " I believe that [ he ] would have sacrificed a thousand or a hundred thousand of his blood to achieve his political goal. He was not interested in old Jews or those who had become assimilated into Hungarian society. 'You can have the others, ' he would say , 'but let me have this group here. ' And because Kastner rendered us a great service by helping keep the deportation camps peaceful , I would let his groups escape. "
