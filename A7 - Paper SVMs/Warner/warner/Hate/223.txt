" ....For nearly 4,000 years , since the ancient inhabitants of Sodom fueled the fires of God 's wrath , sodomites have been called faggots , contracted to fags. It is an elegant metaphor. Faggots in nature are sticks of wood that burn quick , hot and long , and are hence used to fuel the fires of nature. Etymology , history , and Scripture -- all endorse and sanctify the usage of faggot or fag to refer to sodomites , because the sodomites ignite the fires of divine wrath , promised by God Himself to destroy any society that elevates homosexuality to a position of wide acceptance and respect.
