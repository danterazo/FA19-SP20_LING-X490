Race is an artificial thing people. Compare N * ggers from Africa and N * ggers in the US. They are not the same even though they are both black as soot. Deep down we are all the same. We are all humans. Why let all these small little differences divide us ? We all should love each other like brothers and sisters. Love. That is the answer to all our little petty problems. Learn to love ourselves as human beings. Wake up everybody ! : )
