We are concerned about old Aussies without proper community assistance , homelessness amongst youth and families , open borders and security , treaties we never condoned , cheap labour driving Aussies from many jobs and more - while we observe so-called refugees moving into housing commission homes , jobs , welfare bounties and other public benefits. Since 1995 , possibly as much as $ 100 Billion directly and indirectly , has been spent on these parasites. The massive burdens of ` processing ' , the navy , courts , lawyers , super-generous welfare , psychologists , building detention centres and burnt-down centres , teachers , expensive protests , the waste of parliamentary time , security assessments - it just goes on and on. Angry ?
