Most ( not all ) of them walk around with a waddle , with absolutely no intelligence behind their eyes - they seriously look more like animals than humans. Their habits are disgusting and they lack any consideration for those around them , from letting their children deficate on the streets , to snorting up and hoarking giant gobs of spit everywhere , to burping at the table to smoking every place imaginable , to constantly butting in line - they have absolutely no regard for those around them . The worst part is though is that they seem to have no morals or dignity ( and I know that as a Westerner we have a different set of issues as well ) , the Chinese people who actually know me treat me like gold ( which is good and I try to return the treatment as best I can ) but to those whom are strangers they have lied , manipulated and tried to rip me off every chance they could get. Other nations around the world ( including us ) may not necessarily be friendly to strangers but I have never met a culture in all my travels that so remorselessly puts on a smile tries to rip you off. They ( most ) have no concept of right or wrong and are such incredibly selfish people and they see nothing wrong with it .
