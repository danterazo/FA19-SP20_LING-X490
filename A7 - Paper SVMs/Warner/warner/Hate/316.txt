The first Jew to begin trading with the Indians was Hayman Levy. The Indians were fascinated with items of self- adornment ; beads , earrings , armbands , and cloth. These were traded for fur pelts. Soon Jews Nicholas Lowe and Joseph Simon joined Levy in his venture. They decided to begin trading rum and whiskey to the Indians and set up a distillery in Newport. In a very short time there were 22 distilleries in Newport , all owned by Jews. " Firewater " soon became a coveted possession of the Indians resulting in the tragic massacres of early settlers .
