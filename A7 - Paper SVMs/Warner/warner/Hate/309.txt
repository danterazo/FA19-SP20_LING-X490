1 ) The People in China that are on the top are indeed human and are indeed very highly intelligent to create such a scheme , it is brilliant and I envy them. 2 ) How come there are 1.3 billion people in China ? First off they are not people they are Eggborns , lets not get that confused . Well the ruling body on top are Human so that leaves around 1,299,950,000 billion Eggborns. China has been well ahead of the rest of the world in terms of technology. They have had the hive setup and active for many generations now. While we were making dogs slobber in a lab ( Pavlov ) The Chinese were already figuring out a way to reproduce human like beings from large soft shelled eggs. Once the ruling humans on top felt they had enough eggborns to significantly over populate every landmass in the world they started sending them out in mass numbers. Starting just a few decades ago. 3 ) This is why the Eggborn males have such small penises . They are not used for reproduction. Their penis acts as merely a place holder and urinator. It is not used for reproduction because it is not needed. 4 ) Why do many Chinese People Look Identical ? Many of the Eggborns appear to look alike quite simply because they have very similar lineage . A common birth mother which I have not seen first hand but I am fairly confidant that it is similar to the mother from the movie " Aliens " . The sperm is synthetic and of typical low Made in China quality .
