" By what criteria has the UJA chosen the worldwide robber baron for this years ' award over , say , Radovan Karadzic [ accused of war crimes in Bosnia ] , or perhaps Larry Flynt [ the pornographer ] ? " wondered Eric Alterman in the Nation , " ... Murdoch was chosen , the UJA says , for his 'longtime support of the security of the state of Israel , his friendship for the Jewish people , and his support of UJA. ' " [ ALTERMAN , p. 6-7 ] The Australian-born Murdoch had earlier been honored in 1982 as the " Communications Man of the Year " by the American Jewish Congress. He was presented that award by AJC president Howard Squadron , who was also Murdoch 's American lawyer , his guide to visit right-wing politician Ariel Sharon in Israel , and an opinion page writer for Murdoch 's New York Post . [ GOLDSTEIN , T , p. 69 ; KIERNAN , T. , 1986 , p. 262 ] " The Jewish national cause is one that is extremely important to me , to my family , and to my company , " Murdoch told the UJA audience , " ... We 're also in Israel [ Murdoch has investments there ] because of my faith in the integrity and worthiness of the Zionist undertaking. I have been accused of being pro-Israel , pro-Zionist , pro-Jewish -- charges to which I plead guilty. " [ LEON , M. , 7-4-1997 , p. 16 ] ( See the following link to trace the quotes above )
