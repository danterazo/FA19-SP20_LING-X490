Viacom was formed in 1971 as a way to dodge an anti-monopoly FCC ruling that required CBS to spin off a part of its cable TV operations and syndicated programming business. This move by the government unfortunately did nothing to reduce the mostly Jewish collaborative monopoly that remains the major problem with the industry. In 1999 , after CBS had again augmented itself by buying King World Productions ( a leading TV program syndicator ) , Viacom acquired its progenitor company , CBS , in a double mockery of the spirit of the 1971 ruling .
