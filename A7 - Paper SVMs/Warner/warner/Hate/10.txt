Providing an alternative to Islam The Muslims who have abandoned Islam will need somewhere else to go. Some will abandon religion altogether and become secularists , but as most people need some sort of religious belief in their life an alternative must be provided. This means that apostates ( people who have converted out of Islam ) will need protection from the murderous intentions of their former co-religionists . Attempts to intimidate apostates must be treated as serious hate-crimes and punished with the utmost severity .
