I like Ron Paul. I support his stand on foreign policy related matters and his objectives on what need to be changed. I applaud Paul 's stand on our liberties , and I back his quest for a much smaller government. I have done so for years. Please do n't let the establishment succeed in their plot. Bruce Fein is the greatest threat to Paul 's movement to date. He would be a stain - a taint ; not one easily removed after the fact. Please begin the countdown , and have Ron Paul remove this man from the campaign as a trusted advisor and insider. Let the countdown begin today ; at this hour -at this very minute .
