First of all , I 'd be no better off listening to you than I would a Nazi . You 're biased ; it 's as simple as that ! I read and reread a lot of neutral history books and commemorate August 14t with my Hindu brothers. You 're clearly a muslim so dishonesty must come as second nature to you . Personally , I 'm for rationalism , no doubt another concept you are unable to grasp. Secondly , you were never around when these events took place , so your opinion is neither informed nor expert , however many scholars of history throughout the world Middle Eastern / Western agree that many ( indeed the worst ) atrocities have been committed by muslims. Deal with it , dude , youaEUR ( TM ) re an islamofacist rather like the people featured in the video .
