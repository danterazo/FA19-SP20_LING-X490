Now this is hard for some people to understand. They ask , How could Jesus be a Jew , with all Jews fighting everything that relates to Christianity and His Name ? Of course the great confusion that exists in the minds of many is in the fact that they have been ill-informed concerning who the house of Israel actually is , and they do not know that there is a vast distinction between the house of Israel ( the descendants of Abraham ) and the people called Jews today. But we can establish for you clearly apart from these phases of identity that Jesus Christ is not a Jew , or else all the foundations of Christianity have been wasted upon something that is fatuous and that has no foundation whatsoever. We will also establish this very clearly for you on the basis of Christ 's time , as well as facts which are self-evident as key points within the faith of Christianity .
