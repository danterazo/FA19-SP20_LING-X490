The Allied carpet-bombing destroyed the supply lines for the Camps , and so the death-toll mounted from famine and disease. Leaflets were dropped from the air , alleging that at Auschwitz a ` final solution'/extermination of Jews policy was being conducted , using gas. [ 43 ] That was the genesis of the story , as those Allied-propaganda leaflets were believed. Greeted by the sight , of rows of famished Jews who had died of e.g. typhoid , it was not hard to see its confirmation. ` Far from it being common knowledge in Germany that people were being gassed ... the vast majority of Germans were horrified by the United Nations accusations and they protested that they had never heard of such acts until after the cessation of hostilities when they had begun listening to United Nations broadcasts .... Since the British Broadcasting Corporation had been broadcasting these accusations regularly for many months before the end of the war , those Germans who had " common knowledge " of the gassing before the war 's end most likely got this " knowledge " from the BBC ! ' [ 44 ] The gas-chamber legend was born in December 1941 , when the German author Thomas Mann declared on the BBC that , in German hospitals , the severely wounded , the old and the feeble were culled with poison gas. This was the ` first appearance of gas chambers in propaganda. ' [ 45 ]
