In the Bible we have no genealogy as to who Mary is. Mary is the only physical embodiment and contact of Christ. Here in Matthew it says : " .. . Mary , of whom was born Jesus , Who is called Christ " . Nowhere in the genealogy , if you go back to the Old Testament , was the mother ever mentioned. It always tells which father begat whom down through all time . Why was the mother mentioned here ? Why did it not mention the mother down through all this course ? Because one of the facts of this time in history was that the Virgin Mary was the mother of Christ and His only physical contact on earth. Was she a jewess ? Absolutely not !
