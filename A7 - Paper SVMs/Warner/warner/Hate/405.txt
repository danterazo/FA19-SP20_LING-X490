To further illustrate the breadth of Jewish media control , we note that Jewish magnate Arthur Sulzberger 's media empire today includes not only the New York Times ( which , in Stalin 's day , systematically covered up the genocidal crimes of Jewish commissars in Communist U.S.S.R ) , but also the Boston Globe , the Lexington Dispatch ( NC ) , the Gainesville Sun ( FL ) , the Ocala Star Banner ( FL ) , the Tuscaloosa News ( AL ) , the Spartansburg Herald Journal ( SC ) , and the Santa Barbara News Press ( CA ) . Each of the newspapers Lillienthal mentioned back in 1978 , in turn , owned and still owns dozens of others. So tainted is the news because of this that almost every newspaper in America endorsed President George Bush 's radically pro-Israel policies in the Middle East , including Israel 's savage butchery of Lebanon and Palestine .
