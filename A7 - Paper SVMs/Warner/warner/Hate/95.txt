A little yellow chinaman was standing by the sea one day skipping flat stones across the water. As each stone skipped across the water it made the sound , " chin - chang - chung " . The chinaman did this several times , " chin - chang - chung , chin - chang - chung " . As the chinaman was skipping these stones , a nigger came up and asked him " Yo , li'l yello-man , Wha'dup ? Wha ' you doin ' wit ' dem stones ? " The chinaman replied , " I using these stones to find my ancestors , my father chin , my grandfather chang , and my great-grandfather chung. " The nigger thought a little and said , " Think I could do dat 2 ? " The chinaman told the nigger to try. The nigger picked up an rock and threw it into the water - " Kersplash " was the sound it made. " No , No , you do it wrong ! " said the chinaman , " you must skip the stone. " Then the china man proceeded to demonstrate , " chin - chang - chung " . The nigger said , " I see how yer doin ' it now. Le'me try again. " He picked up another flat stone and flung it into the water. It skipped across the water magnificently and as it did it made the sound , " Chim - pan - Zee " . The now infuriated nigger ran over to a large boulder , picked it up and slammed it onto the ground making a thunderous " BAB-BOON ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! " sound that echoed for miles !
