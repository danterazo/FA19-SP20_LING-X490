I believe this a fantastic world in which to be alive today. There are so many opportunities to do good , while at the same time evil is on full display at a time when some people have n't been wasting their time figuring out which Nazi car to buy in order to satisfy ones brainwashed notions about being hip and cool and saving the planet. That is n't the message I get when I see a VW or when I consider the fact that what is just a chemical company today was really a genocidal death machine . Excuse me for being blunt , but frankly for me every day is fucking nine eleven .
