The nearest we have to primary-source documents concerning what went on within the camps , comes from the bulky , three-volume International Red Cross Report published in 1948. This and especially Volume III describes the couple of thousand regular , routine inspection-visits that its doctors made through the war years to the Polish labour-camps. Their report never hints at any gas-chamber , nor any mass-cremations. While maintaining a politically neutral position [ 32 ] , it confirms that mortality in the camps was to a large extent caused by the allied terror-bombing. [ 33 ] Likewise Winston Churchill 's bulky , six-volume account of the War gives no allusion to the subject , especially volume Six , Triumph and Tragedy where one would expect to have some allusion if he believed it had happened.
