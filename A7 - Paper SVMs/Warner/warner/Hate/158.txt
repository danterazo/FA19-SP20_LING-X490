Scheuer : Well if it was a real ally like Canada or Britain or Australia we would be surprised , but it 's a pleasant surprise to me to find out that the FBI is spying on the Israelis. The Israelis are certainly an immensely malign influence in the United States. They steal our technology , they suborn government employees to spy for them and transfer documents , and certainly their influence through citizen groups like AIPAC on the Congress is politically corrupting. So I think they 're perfectly correct to be spying on the Israelis .
