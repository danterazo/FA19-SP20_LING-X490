As surprising as it may sound , the only intentional mass extermination program in the concentration camps of WW2 was targeted at Germans. From April , 1945 five million Germans were rounded up after surrendering , and deliberately starved until well over one million had died , in French and American-run concentration camps [ 1 ] - an event soon erased from the history books. There was , in contrast , never a centrally-coordinated Nazi program of exterminating Jews in Germany. Lethal gas chambers did not function in German labour-camps , that 's just an illusion. The traditional Holocaust story has developed out of rumours , misunderstandings , and wartime propaganda. From stories pre-dating the Second World War to the Nuremberg Trials which gave official sanction to the notion , to subsequent trials , books and films , we have had it imprinted on our collective psyche. In most of Europe now , it is a thoughtcrime to believe what you have just read , punishable by imprisonment , so think carefully before deciding to read on .
