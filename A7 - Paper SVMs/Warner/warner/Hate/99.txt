2 priests are arguing over whether God is black or White. Finally the one says he will just go ask God himself. When he comes back he says with a shrug , " I do n't know , he just said 'I am what I am ' " The other priest says , Well , that proves it ! God is white ! " " How can you be so sure ? " " Well , because , if God was a nigger he would have said , " I is what I is. "
