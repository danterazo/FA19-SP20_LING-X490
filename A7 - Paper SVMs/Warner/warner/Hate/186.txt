Truth is I got family in the suburbs and a few friends there. I hate the fuckin burbs. I hate the candy coated white life those kids are growin up in. Those kids ai n't gettin a dose of reality like they should be. Then it causes them to grow up and deny that bad shits goin on to the poor people. Then when a nigga stands up and tells them about the shit they get pissed off and call the nigga a racist .
