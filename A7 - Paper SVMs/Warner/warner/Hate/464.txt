" This ` big lie ' technic is brainwashing U.S.A. Christians into believing that Jesus Christ was " King of the Jews " , in the sense that so-called ` Jews ' today call themselves ` Jews'. This reference was first made in English translations of the Old and New Testaments , centuries before the so-called Jews highjacked the word ` Jew ' in the 19th A.D. century to palm themselves off on the Christian world as having a kinship with Jesus Christ. This alleged kinship comes from the myth of their common ancestry with the so-called ` Jews ' of the Holy Land in the Old Testament history , a fiction based on fable. "
