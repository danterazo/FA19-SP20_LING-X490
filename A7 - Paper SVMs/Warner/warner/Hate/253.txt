I 'm Chinese , though I 'm not from China , and not exactly from US either ... but I 'm living here now. And yes , Chinese people from China are extremely rude and disgusting. Not all of them , of course , but just saying. Although , please do n't think badly of all Chinese because of this. And do n't say " I only like the civilized , American born Chinese " because being born in a native country , I have met many very nice and kind Chinese - though they may not speak English as well ! ; )
