There are other , non-Bedouin Muslims , mainly in the Nile Delta of Egypt and in the river plains of Iran and Iraq. The millennia-long agricultural heritage imbued them with certain work ethics , but their habits are still tremendously behind those required in the technological age. It is not for nothing that even in Israel , Arab graduates of Jewish universities lag far behind the Jews in employment. Or that the Israeli Arab farmers are backward compared to Jewish farmers just a few miles away from them . The world 's economy is satiated with the diligent hands of China and Southeast Asia : there is no demand for Arab hands. The Agricultural revolution , which touches the Islamic world only now , will produce huge unemployment in agriculture , flood Muslim cities with jobless , unskilled peasants , and radicalize their societies-as happened in Russia in the early twentieth century and as happens in Turkey today. No amount of Israeli involvement would significantly improve Arab economies .
