Incredibly , Avraham Stern , the leader of the notorious " Stern Gang , " late in 1940 , made a written proposal to Hitler , by which the Jewish militias in Palestine , would fight on " Germany 's side , " in the war against England , in exchange for the Nazis help in resolving the " Jewish Question " in Europe , and their assistance in creating an " historic Jewish state. " By this date , German troops had already marched into Prague , invaded Poland , and had built the first concentration camp at Auschwitz . The deranged Stern had further bragged about how the Zionist organizations were " closely related to the totalitarian movements of Europe in [ their ] ideology and structure. " Stern 's obscene proposal was found in the German embassy , in Turkey , after WWII .
