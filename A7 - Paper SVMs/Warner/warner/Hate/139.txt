Have n't you noticed that since the beginning of 2010 , we can no longer download videos from youtube. I used to do it a lot with realplayer . Everytime I came across a video that was of interest to me I would download it , until early this year. Jewtube is owned by yahoo. As of two years ago the ceo of Yahoo was Terry Semel ( Jewish ) He was replaced by Carol Ann Bartz in January 2009. She definitely has a Jewish-sounding surname. These Jews do n't want us to donwload anything that might be compromising to them because they know we will share it elsewhere. I just got one of my videos removed again because it mentionned them as Freemasons wanting to rule the world. I 'm gon na put it back , even if I have to open another account. We have to fight these scums .
