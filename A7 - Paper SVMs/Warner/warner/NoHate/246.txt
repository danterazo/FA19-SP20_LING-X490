In a very race-conscieous ( let 's not mention " racist " word ) country such as the USA , some clever politician invented this " Asian-American " concept but nobody ever bothered to mention " European-American " . To lump together all those folks who have " Asian " ancestry into one big basket is akin to put all the Italians , Romanians , Poles in the same bed with the noble Brits , proud French , arrogant German and Swiss who all have very different and distinct culture , language , and ethnicity except they are all whites. Yet the Asians ( yet they even include " Pacific-Islanders " into the same category in political palance ) as we have here in the US have many many differences , even the skin colours. There are yellow , brown and black ( yes , those from Papua-New Guinea and Micronesia ) . Culturally , Japanese culture surely very different from Chinese or Korean or Indonesian or Indian , for instance. How can you expect such a mixed-up " group " be able to identify themselves and show some kind of solidarity or cohesiveness ? Big joke. The Jews , for example , even after many generations in the US , still go to his Bar Mitzva and celebrate Passover , and care more about Israel than America. Even the " European-Americans " still do not see eye to eye , although they are all white. How could Asian-Americans be any better ? Behind the rhetorics of racial eqaulity , we all have deep-set pre-conceived notions and prejudices against each other. This is fact of life in America. Stop being hypocritical and be honest to yourself .
