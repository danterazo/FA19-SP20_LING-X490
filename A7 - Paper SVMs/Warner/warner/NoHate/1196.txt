Religion as the main aspect of the OIC emerges from its language and its targets. It seems that the OIC is restoring in the 21st century the Caliphate , the supreme controlling body for all Muslims. In their Charter ( 2008 ) , Member States confirm that their union and solidarity are inspired by Islamic values. They affirm their aim to reinforce within the international arena their shared interests and the promotion of Islamic values. They commit themselves to revitalizing the pioneering role of Islam in the world , increasing the prosperity of the member states , and -- in contrast to to the European states -- to ensure the defense of their national sovereignty and territorial integrity. They proclaim their support for Palestine with al-Quds Al Sharif , the Arabized name for Jerusalem , as its capital , and exhort each other to promote human rights , basic freedoms , the state of law ( shari'a ) , and democracy according to their constitutional and legal system -- in other words , compliance with shari'a .
