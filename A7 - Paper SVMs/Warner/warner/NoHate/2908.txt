As a white man who has lived in africa,for 20 years,i whould like to say you are the most nasty unpleasent human i have seen.PLEASE LEAVE USA and western world.Maybe as a 50 year old the idea that you treat women with respect is old fashioned,this applies indepentantly of there race ? Do you refer to your own mother this way,or your sisters,or the female , male child,maybe one day you will grow up ,when you have a child born out of your woman,and you will weep tears of joy , at the life you have in your hands. THIS IS THE TRUE MEANING OF BEING A MAN./BEYOND SKIN COLOUR
