In ` On Egypt ' I wrote about how protests never topple governments. I think the Gaddafi 's response to the protests ( direct confrontation ) demonstrates one of two options available to leaders with major protests : either that or ` waiting it out ' ( as is best done in the West where protests never equate to anything ) . Since directly confronting protestors has damaged his reputation , I doubt he will resign ; especially after the sanctions , he call for a war crimes inquiry as well as calls for his resignation .
