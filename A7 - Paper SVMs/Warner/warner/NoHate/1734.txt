as for the last sentence you picked on , how is that fighting words exactly ? how could you possibly not see that western society has only been possible by the exploitation of disadvantaged people ? like , oh you know , indigenous peoples , whose land we stole and whom we rounded up into little internment camps called reserves ? or , oh i dunno , the africans who were captured and stolen and shiped across the ocean to perform menial labour and suffer grave abuse and injustice as slaves ? or , the millions of women who have been treated like pieces of reproductive meat for thousands of years ? I included that sentence because I BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE. As for what my prof thought about it - those kinds of manipulations do n't really enter into my work. I would n't include or not include a sentence because of who was going to be reading my paper .
