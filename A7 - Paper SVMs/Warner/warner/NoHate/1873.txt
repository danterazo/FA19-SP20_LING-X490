Around 500,000 prisoners were registered in the labour-camps of Auschwitz in Poland , of which some 130,000 died [ 20 ] . Bodies were there disposed of by individual cremation , and the records for coke fuel consumption over the period February 1942 - October 1943 for the cremation ovens indicate that around five thousand bodies were then burnt. That accords with the number of registered , deceased inmates , viz those who had died from natural causes [ 21 ] , who had to be cremated rather than buried because of the great typhoid epidemics. This demonstrates that no mass-incineration of bodies took place. Josef Kramer , a supervisor at the Auschwitz camp , gave a statement after the war which is recommended by Professor Butz as probably genuine : it had 350-500 deaths per week happening over May-November 1944 , all from natural causes , a very high figure because sick prisoners were sent there , and the dead were all cremated. He believed the camp held up to 100,000 prisoners , mainly Poles and Prussians. [ 22 ]
