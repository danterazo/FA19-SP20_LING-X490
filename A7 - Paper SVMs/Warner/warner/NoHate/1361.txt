American corporate complicity and Adolf Hitler 's Final Solution Who gave Adolf Hitler the basis for turning centuries of hatred into a new twentieth century political anti-Semitism ? It was Henry Ford , who bought a failed newspaper , which serialized the Protocols of the Elders of Zion for 91 weeks. Then he published the series as a book , The International Jew. Adolf Hitler read his work at least two years before Mein Kampf was written. No wonder Ford got Hitler 's German Eagle medal. Who gave Hitler the principles to justify a war to achieve a master race with the duty to kill all inferior races ? It was the American Carnegie Institution , which set up science programs in post-WW1 Germany , to teach the deadly race science of eugenics. ( jewishtimes.com )
