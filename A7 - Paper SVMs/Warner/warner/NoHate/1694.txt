The discrimination against European Americans can even be found in the news coverage of the tragic murders at Virginia Tech. At the present time I am lecturing in Europe , but I can tune in on the American media by way of CNN International. When I heard about the killings I tuned in and watched an hour wrap up of the coverage that evening. Although the overwhelming majority of the slain students and faculty ( 22 out of 32 ) were European Americans , a majority of the broadcast centered on an Israeli and an African American victim. The overwhelming majority of the coverage centered a Jewish victim of the shooting , a Holocaust survivor who was touted as a hero for trying to block the door with other students to keep Cho out of his room. CNN showed extensive interviews with his family in Israel. The other victim covered extensively was the lone male African American victim and again heartfelt interviews with his family and friends were aired. On the broadcast no other victim 's family gave any interviews .
