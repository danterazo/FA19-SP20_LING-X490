* American Jewish Fantasies of Israel : Coping With Cognitive Dissonance By Leon Hadar ( Washington Report 08/1989 ) . Discusses how the image of Israel in the minds of American Jews is basically a fantasy that is quite different from reality. Also , tells how the Israeli Hebrew press describes a vastly more accurate picture of the events and sins of Israel , than the image of Israel in Ameircan Jews ' minds. When not told about the origin of some Israeli press articles they were asked to examine , most of American Jews thought it was from an anti-Semitic or anti-Israel Arab press. No one guessed it was the Israeli press. The difference between the Israeli and the American Jewish press are a further testament to that .
