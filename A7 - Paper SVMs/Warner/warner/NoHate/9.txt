The second thing I hate about Asians is how little pride most of them have. This may be the result of societal brainwashing , but whatever the cause , it must stop. I am repulsed when I see Asian guys speak with British accents in an attempt to sound sophisticated. British people ca n't be all that sophisticated if they do n't yet understand the concept of dental hygiene. I am also sickened when I hear Asian people imitate Negro slang in an endeavor to sound " ghetto. " Am I supposed to be impressed that such a person emulates the attitude of a supposed slum resident ? More importantly , whatever happened to being yourself ?
