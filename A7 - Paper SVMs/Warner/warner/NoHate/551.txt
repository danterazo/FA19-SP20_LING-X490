43. As an asian american , I am appalled by comments made by Mr. Eng. He obviously is too young ( naive ) to experience or direct contact with the African American community. I have Black friends , and been doing business in the Black community. For Mr.Eng to explicitly voiced his generialisation about African American is totally uncallful , and crap. He should take a lession in black history , and have a better understanding of African American people before he opened his big mouth. What an idiot the author made himself... .
