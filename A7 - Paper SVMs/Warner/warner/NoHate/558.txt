It is , perhaps , when the words of our country 's most nefarious citizens are spoken and defended that the United States radiates most brightly . Yesterday , the Supreme Court stood by the Westboro Baptist Church , suppressing a lawsuit that would seek to strip the congregation of a fundamental and invaluable human right. Members of the church were taken to court by the father of a slain Marine who took legal objection to a protest assembled a police-ordered 1,000 feet away from his son 's funeral. This was not the first funeral protested by the church-indeed they have made quite a habit of such demonstrations. By their own estimates , members of the Westboro Baptist Church have conducted over 30,000 protests in two decades. The sheer number of demonstrations is staggering , let alone the typical content , which tends to consist of signs bearing wildly inflammatory rhetoric : " God Hates Fags , " " Thank God For Dead Soldiers , " and " Thank God For 9/11 " are used frequently .
