What should be done about peace talks with Arabs is simple : nothing . Israel gains nothing from peace treaties with Saudi Arabia , Lebanon , and the like. We will not risk substantially reducing the IDF , and Arabs will not start loving us as cousins. Palestinian peace advances should be ignored : if they want a state , let them proclaim it in whatever areas they actually possess. If they continue fighting us , we will fight back as one fights states. If they carp about Jerusalem or the settlement blocs , we will repel that aggressor state. No Palestinian migrant workers in Israel , no trade with Palestine , no services provided to it , just abandon the areas densely settled by Arabs. Many countries have unruly border areas , and Israel can live with an unruly West Bank. Do n't object to Palestinian statehood and do n't agree to it , but ignore it. In any negotiations , Israel only gives , but takes nothing. Abandoning all negotiations with Arabs is objectively the most beneficial approach Israel can take .
