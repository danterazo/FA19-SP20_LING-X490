Good question ! I have been amazed at how so many suicide bombings are taking place by Muslims against Muslims. Not that it should be ok against non-Muslims ... but considering the teachings of the Qur'an and ahadith , one would expect that a line would be drawn at least against attacking Muslim civilian centers. I think this is a result of doctrines/concepts like " jahiliyyah " as they are expounded by Sayyid Qutb and others influential writers. These militants somehow convince themselves either that they are fighting against apostates or that Muslims as collateral damage is acceptable .
