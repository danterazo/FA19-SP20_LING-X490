` The enemy of subversive thought is not suppression , but publication : truth has no need to fear the light of day ; fallacies wither under it . The unpopular views of today are the commonplaces of tomorrow , and in any case the wise man wants to hear both sides of every question. ' Sir Stanley Unwin
