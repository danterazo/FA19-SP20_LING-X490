What I am getting at is this : The National Socialists did not confuse strength , bravery and masculinity with being a bully ; people were not encouraged to view women as weak and fundamentally flawed and immoral. It worked , and , if it were not for scum like Churchill , FDR , Truman and Stalin , and all of their lies and warmongering , it would have continued to work .
