How could you forget the first Thanksgiving ? Now did that look like a massacre to you ? That was a peaceful moment between Native Americans and whites that smart people do n't forget. How dare you just go around like this accusing folks of having a history of killing when you do n't even have a clue about what good went on between two races , one you stick up for ( Where first , its wrong to be racist ) , and one that you forget the wrongness of racism for and blame everything on them. They should really put you somewhere where you 'll be beaten and disciplined , because calling people 's ancestors " nasty " is way out of line .
