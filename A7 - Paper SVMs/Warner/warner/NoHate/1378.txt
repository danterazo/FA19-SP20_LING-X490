Frankfurt School ( kulturmarxisme ) is a very ambitious unofficial ideology ( and quite unknown to most ) and they have succeeded in most areas ( except to smash capitalism , European Christianity and European identity , traditions , culture ) . Vienna school is more a defense against this where we often use the Marxist 'own creations against them ( sexual liberation , feminism , liberalism , anti-racism , anti-autoriaere arguments ) .
