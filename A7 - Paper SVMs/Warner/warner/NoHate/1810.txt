Arab societies , on the other hand , are seen as backwards , intolerant , fanatical , anti-American and violent. There is not much of a connection at all. Americans are repulsed by the use of terror , sharia punishments in Saudi Arabia , and what they see as the mistreatment of women and Christians. It is not a race issue per say - I am Hispanic-American and these beliefs are alive and well in a community whose members often have a similar skin tone .
