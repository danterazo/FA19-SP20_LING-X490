This artice is right on. I haved lived in Germny and the U.S. for five years now. The German people and their behavior is problematic. I belive that it comes from their history and nervous mentalty towards anyone or thing that they perceive to be better or greater than themselves. The culture wants to dominate thus they act out sometimes in an evil manner . The problem is German values always lead to hate and self detruction. If their cowardly gvernment would lead its people away from fear and macho ideology Germany would be great. This will not happen due to its leaders inability to lead wit morality ( e.g. J.F.K or Ronald Regan .
