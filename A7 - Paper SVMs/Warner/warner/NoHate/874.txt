The control of the opinion-molding media is nearly monolithic. All of the controlled media * television , radio , newspapers , magazines , books , motion pictures * speak with a single voice , each reinforcing the other. Despite the appearance of variety , there is no real dissent , no alternative source of facts or ideas accessible to the great mass of people that might allow them to form opinions at odds with those of the media masters. They are presented with a single view of the world * a world in which every voice proclaims the equality of the races , the inerrant nature of the Jewish " Holocaust " tale , the wickedness of attempting to halt the flood of non-White aliens pouring across our borders , the danger of permitting citizens to keep and bear arms , the moral equivalence of all sexual orientations , and the desirability of a " pluralistic , " cosmopolitan society rather than a homogeneous , White one. It is a view of the world designed by the media masters to suit their own ends * and the pressure to conform to that view is overwhelming. People adapt their opinions to it , vote in accord with it , and shape their lives to fit it .
