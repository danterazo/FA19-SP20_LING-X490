Yep , that 's right. After Zimbabweing Americans to death while under a cloud of radioactive sulfur that has swooped down on the West Coast of America from nuke particles coming into contact with sea water in Japan , the whole thing is unraveling. Utopia ai n't worth a shit , now is it ? Thought so. And by the way , GE brings good things to death , not life. But this is what happens when being all things to all people just fucking turns into a joke , and the corporate media 's job is to promote that false notion. People are no different than any other living creature in one respect. There are rules of the game of life. Abide by them and prosper . Defy them and you will most certainly pay the consequences. But of course , denial is not a river in Egypt , because if it were then Egyptians would n't themselves be such suckers for the utopia hopeandchange routine that they fell for and are STILL , I repeat STILL without food and their gubmint is now a military dictatorship , which uses al Qaeda and the Bruslim Motherhood as its gangland enforcers .
