I have to say that I agree broadly with your view that Arabs should be held mostly responsible for the problems you mentioned and that have affected their development over the last decades. On the other hand the Israeli-Palestinian issue can not be disconnected from the control the US retains over the region , through the proxy 'friendly ' regimes. It would be like blaming South and Central America for its underdevelopment without acknowledging the role played by the US in maintaining corruption , nepotism and gross inequalities .
