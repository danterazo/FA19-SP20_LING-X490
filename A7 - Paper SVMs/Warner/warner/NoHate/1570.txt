frankly , both the points of there being no true " free " speech and that there exists no " right " of free speech , sound like word games - restricting one 's speech by sentence structure - for example - does not seem to me to have anything to do with free speech with respect to how the term is commonly used - to equate the restrictions of sentence structure , to the restrictions a state could put on content - well , it 's not the same
