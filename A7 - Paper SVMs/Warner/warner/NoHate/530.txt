The principles of belief are ( 1 ) that some races , or at least one race , are superior and therefore the others are inferior. The superior races are entitled to privileges to which the inferior races are not entitled . ( 2 ) Races can not live in harmony with one another ; coexistence is precluded by the very nature of the relationship ; racial incompatibility is an essential corollary to racial diversity. Two principles of practice follow : ( 1 ) since races can not live with one another , since they are essentially diverse , they must be separated ; racial segregation is an essential prerequisite of a healthy international existence. ( 2 ) Where races coexist , supremacy and discrimination by one race against another are the inevitable consequence .
