But the heinous claims did n't stop. The withered , backward , lonely , cruel and twisted old man had more to say , as he went on to describe all black people as " destructive " and " nihilistic " , just like those black Nobel Peace Prize winners , say Bunche , or Luthuli , or Dr King , or El Sadat , or Archbishop Tutu , or Mandela , or Annan , or Maathai , or Obama - how destructive they all were. And he still sits there , singing the praises of the prophetic racist Enoch Powell , please , I mean is he even for real .
