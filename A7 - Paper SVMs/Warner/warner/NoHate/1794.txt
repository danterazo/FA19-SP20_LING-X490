5 Years in China and it is really hard to keep a fair and balanced opinion about these people. On the one hand I have been show the most unselfish kindnesses from people on the street , in the classromms and elsewhere ! I have been sensitively not stared at by 'most ' people. I have eaten in people 's homes which were immacculately cleaned. I have enjoyed sport , employment and ssocial activities. On the other hand , all of that should be normal ! It should all happen without stress and anxiety , but it has n't. All the good is outweighed and overshadowed by the sheer stupditiy which has preceeded , accompanied and exceeded it ! I am deeply unhappy at my overall experience of life in China ! I can not beleive that they are really human and part of the original creation. It is as they say ; " Descendants of the Great Dragon " ie satan. It is the only thing that adequately explains the waywardness of their collective conscience and their need to lie. Stupidity and Evil have much in common ; I feel very sad for the truly good people of China who bare the ignomy of their fellows. I pray Jesus protect us from them. Because the world is divided into us and China .
