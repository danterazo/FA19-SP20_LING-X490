` Starting in May 1945 with the alleged suicides of SS-General Hans-Adolf Pru : tzmann , SS head Heinrich Himmler and SS-General Odilo Globocnik while in British captivity , there followed a bizarre string of murders of individuals associated with the Auschwitz concentration camp. ( These were perpetrated by a Jewish hit squad known as the DIN. ) As Joseph Bellinger , author of a new book on Himmler 's murder , points out , within six months or so of the war 's end practically any one who could have shed light on the Jewish policy of the Third Reich was murdered ! ' This , it must be said , was extremely convenient for the prosecution at Nuremberg. [ 56 ]
