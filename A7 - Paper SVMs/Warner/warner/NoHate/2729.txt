As the center of gravity of the Cold War shifted , from Southeast Asia to Southern Africa , there was also a shift in US strategy. The Nixon Doctrine had been forged towards the closing years of the Vietnam War but could not be implemented at that late stage - the doctrine that " Asian boys must fight Asian wars " - was really put into practice in Southern Africa. In practice , it translated into a US decision to harness , or even to cultivate , terrorism in the struggle against regimes it considered pro-Soviet. In Southern Africa , the immediate result was a partnership between the US and apartheid South Africa , accused by the UN of perpetrating " a crime against humanity. " Reagan termed this new partnership " constructive engagement. "
