In terms of freedom of speech being a right , I have to retain my position. Rights are based on natural law theory - basically the theory , developed by philosophers such as St Thomas Aquinas , that humans have inherent , or natural , rights based on laws of nature. Natural rights are the basis of human rights , for example. Rights are both positive - I am entitled to a thing , such as voting , and society has a duty to provide it for me - and negative - usually non-interference. Rights imply duties : if I have a right , it is your duty to support me in that right. At best , freedoms are negative rights , and negative rights are largely political freedoms. Freedom of speech would be a negative right , and I think a secondary one : it does not involve security of the person. I hope that clarifies the idea of Natural rights a bit .
