My friend believes in God , without equivocation , and my friend is outraged at yoke that must be borne by true Muslim believers because of the disintegration of Islam. The shame of many- but not all , who go to mosques to pray , can not be measured. My friend describes an unwritten code and language decent Muslims share , so that they might find each other. They are too frightened to speak freely and they are too frightened to stand up to the bullies that have taken over the mosques and Islamic schools. They are the messengers of those that have redefined Islam .
