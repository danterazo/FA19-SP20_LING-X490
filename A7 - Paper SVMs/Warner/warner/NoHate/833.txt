You were always brilliant in morning Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee You philosophies on art , Baroque moved you You loved Mozart and you 'd speak of your loved ones As I clumsily strummed my guitar You 'd teach me of honest things Things that were daring , things that were clean Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean So I hid my soiled hands behind my back Somewhere along the line I must 've gone off track with you Excuse me , think I 've mistaken you for somebody else Somebody who gave a damn , somebody more like myself
