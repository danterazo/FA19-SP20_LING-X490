It is now written into law in Europe that any distinctiveness ( i.e . " diversity " ) must be ignored. Any expression of , or references to , evident differences in behaviour , appearance , culture , or economic and integrative potential are expressly and specifically prohibited. Severe penalties are imposed for any who disincline .
