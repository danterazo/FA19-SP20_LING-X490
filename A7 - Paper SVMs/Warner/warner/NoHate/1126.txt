The " who " part is the problem for me. Like you I 'm offended by hate speech , and I wish I could make it go away. But I do n't think there is any " who " available I could trust - me included - to have the wisdom , benevolence and innate sense of fairness that would offer any prospect that these new laws would n't be abused just as existing laws are. I think it is impossible to develop any objective , correct consensus on who the marginalized groups are , and the exact particulars of the type of speech that would be suppressed .
