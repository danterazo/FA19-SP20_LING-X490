k yes a lot of chinese people smell and are rude and suck at driving , but then again , a lot of other races have those people too. I 'm Portugese and sometimes yes i can recall myself being pissed off at a chinese person and bitching about my anger for them but we all have to realize that its not all Chinese people that are like the common stereotype. I have a few Chinese friends that i absolutely love. And its not because im never around Chinese people... i work in richmond and go to school at UBC where there 's hundreds of Chinese people. Canada 's supposed to be a cultural mosaic not a communist country where we all are ethnocentric assholes . People need to start learning about compassion , that 's all .
