We read the whole genealogy in the book of Matthew from the days of Abraham on down " ... and Eleazar begat Matthan ; and Matthan begat Jacob ; and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary " , and it was Mary of whom Christ was born. So it would not make any difference in all the genealogy of the house of Joseph , as far as the blood stream of Christ was concerned , for Joseph was not the father of Jesus Christ. He was only the adopted foster father , and thus added a rightful title as foster father to Jesus. ( The Jersusalem Bible footnote ( Matt. 1 : 1 ) says " ... Joseph legally the father of Jesus " . ) But Jesus held the title by His right as King of Kings and proved that in His Own conversation with the people of Jerusalem , as we will introduce to you .
