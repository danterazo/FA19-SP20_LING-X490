Following the victory of the Nazi Party , occult tradition became a major part of German people 's culture. The SS 's Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler , who had always been an avid student of the occult , spearheaded this occult tradition. In 1935 the Ahnernerbe ( Ancestral Heritage ) department was established as part of the SS occult research department with SS Colonel Wolfram von Sievers at its head .
