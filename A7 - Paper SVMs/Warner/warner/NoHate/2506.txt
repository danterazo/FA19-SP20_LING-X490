I 've been coming to NiggaKnow for a couple years now , but only today decided to finally register.I was kinda hoping to find The Last Real New Yorker on Twitter , and follow him , but I guess he 's not tweeting yet . Anyway , I 'm glad I signed up here , 'cause there 's some intensely interesting and illuminating shit being posted in these comment sections , especially from Aaron .
