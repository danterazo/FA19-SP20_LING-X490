Mmm , let 's see here. This piece , while not as " celebrated " as the author 's third effort in the same vein and while it IS " old , " still has legs. As in " Kenneth 's Mother 's " " 28 ugly flat-faced children. " Now , this putative " mother " surely appears to be one , and she/he also rekindles the " issue " anew , as in the obvious existence of haters/baiters like her/him . No wonder the MSM are headlining prognostications on " the Bradley Effect " come Nov. 4. Let 's just hope Ken 's " mom " ca n't afford the gas to drive to the polls that fateful day , in reverse drag or not. P.S. : Bailout bucks apparently are n't doing it , so can " real " regs be far behind ? And does Ken 's mom hold an extensive portfolio of " toxic " " derivatives " ? I sure hope so. Then she/he will probably test the next shipment of Mainland breakables. Or melamine-laced pet food for the indigent .
