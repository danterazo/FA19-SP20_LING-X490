Now , the blame DOES NOT rest solely upon them...they had to learn that from somewhere , they had to put two and two together to say " hey they do it and it 's cool , so maybe if I do it...I 'll be cool too " ...I think people should take responsibility for themselves , but we also need to look behind us and try to understand the filth we leave behind in our wake that others are all too happy to pick up and reuse. I 'm guilty of using the word ni * * a , as are you , and I 'm sure more than half the people that responded here today...so how mad can we actually get when we see someone doing the same thing but being bold enough to get it on film ? What , pray tell , is the difference between Jay-Z making a video using the word...and these fine young gentlemen doing the same ? OH , I know , I know * smack on the forehead * Jay-Z makes money at it .
