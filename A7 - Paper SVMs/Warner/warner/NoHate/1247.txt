Let the show trials begin ! After all , in the final analysis , it 's all just a distraction... IFrame The Obummer administration sends in the jack-booted thugs to raid Gibson Guitar , and of course the bottom line on this is that Gibson is a successful US company , which by the way does not support the current regime. Note to anyone : If a domestic , US company makes money and they do n't pay their allegiance to the fearless leader , then basically they 're screwed. However , if you 're GE and you sell crappy engineered nuke reactors to Japan that results in contamination over the entire planet affecting the health of millions of people , then provided you contribute to the fearless leader you 're A-okay. And if you 're a fledgling solar panel company that id n't worth the paper its stock was printed on , then the same rule applies. And so on and so forth right on down the list , including the big banks , insurance companies , etc. , etc. , etc.. .
