WE BELIEVE that the true , literal children of the Bible are the twelve tribes of Israel , now scattered throughout the world and now known as the Anglo-Saxon , Germanic , Teutonic , Scandinavian , Celtic peoples of the earth. We know that the Bible is written to the family of Abraham , descending from Shem back to Adam. Yahweh blessed Abraham and promised that he would be the " father of nations. " This same promise continued through the seedline of Abraham 's son Isaac , and again to Isaac 's son Jacob , the patriarch of the twelve tribes , whose name Yahweh changed to Israel ( Meaning : " he will rule as God " ) . Genesis 32 : 28 ; Exodus 12 : 31 ; 16 : 4 ; 19 : 20 ; Revelations 21 : 12
