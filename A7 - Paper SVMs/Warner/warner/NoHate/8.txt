The UN loves to use irony when implementing new policies. Mr. Ban appointed a so-called " Human Rights Council , " to be the media watchdog to impose censorship. Meanwhile , the UN hires and appoints investigators to seek and punish whistle-blowers and aid in cover-ups of corruption by initiating " sham " investigation inquiries. The UN also hosts " Transparency Summits , " even though Mr. Ban is notorious for hiding internal UN documents from public scrutiny.
