Hey guys...I am Asian American , and was born here/grew up in the states . Contrary to a lot of stereotypes , I am tall and buff. But I 'm also a musician and love reading books in the liberal arts. I do n't speak mandarin because I was never taught , but I do n't plan on learning it any time soon ( I 've been bad mouthed by Chinese people because of this , and I know because my dad was with me translating ) .
