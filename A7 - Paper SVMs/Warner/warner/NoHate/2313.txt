DSC00736 Quick shot of the action at our 911 Freedom Rally at Ground Zero. I have no time to post ( we are screening our film shortly , The Ground Zero Mosque : The Second Wave of the 911 Attacks , at the Actors Temple Studio in the theater district ) , but our event was incredible. 911 family members , first responders , global voices of freedom and freedom lovers from all over the world converged on West Broadway and Park Place for an historic event .
