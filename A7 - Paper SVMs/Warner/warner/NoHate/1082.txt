But you see , instead of anybody actually doing anything about all this fucking bullshit , people would rather sit around and live out their fantasy of fighting imaginary objects on the teevee. And frankly speaking , that 's the way the gubmint wants ussens to think no how , 'cause let 's face it , when you 've got an imaginary empire to run then ya got ta have people thinkin ' that they bez part of the whole shebang. And of course , for most people this is basically untrue. In fact , if you listen carefully to what the politicians ( all of ` em , to be precise ) are saying , they all have a gubmint plan that 's gon na make sure that everybody is taken care of. First of all , lem me tell anyone categorically that I ai n't go no plans for myself tomorrow much less what plan is gon na make everybody else be taken care of for years to come. Are y'all catching on to where I 'm headed with this ?
