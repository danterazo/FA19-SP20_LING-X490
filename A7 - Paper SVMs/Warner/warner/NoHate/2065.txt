I appreciate Professor John Ogbu work and do n't believe him to be those nasty terms he was called . Why Black Communities like the one in the story will not bhuild schools like those successful all black institutions like a Nation House inj D.C and Marcus Garvey in South Central Los Angeles is beyond myself and others. That is the fault of the black society when there are examples of tremendous success tghat they want duplicate. Another point Black Ameriocans should mimick those schools in Nigeria and other West African Countries. It is the Africans who have the highest educational attainment than any other immigrants including the Asians , that come to the US . Knowing this and having the models that outperform white institutions and not multiplying those positives , then the blame must be on Black Society as a whole .
