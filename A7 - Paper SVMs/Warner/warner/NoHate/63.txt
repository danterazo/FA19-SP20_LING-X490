Yesterday , patriots of all races , creeds and colours came out in support of freedom. Hindus , Sikhs , African Americans , Arab Christians , Indians , and others joined our rainbow coalition and stood against the most extreme and radical ideology on the face of the earth. Huge thanks to Mike Grambush , El Marco , Katie O'Malley , Eliezer Barak , Brandy , Facebook friends , and Pamela Hall for photos .
