Now ask yourself how much sense the government " expert 's " opinion makes , in light of the fact that our Dr. Papcun , the leading forensic audiologist in the world , also uses Sound-Forge , the very same program the government used in discrediting Walsh. Even so , Judge Winmill ruled that Walsh was not " qualified " to testify as an expert , despite his 20 years ' experience in the field. However , Dr. Papcun used Sound-Forge , too , to find most of the same anomalies as did Walsh , thus allowing him to agree with Walsh 's findings , though not wishing to go quite so far as to articulate the same conclusions as did Walsh .
