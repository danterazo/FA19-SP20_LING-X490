It is through the bonds of blood that we are given our race and culture . It is the essential creator of our very people , and our personalities . Through the mixing of alien blood with our own pure blood , we will find nothing but desecration. As Mr. Rosenberg points out in The Myth of the 20thCentury , if we are to envision a future for our race , we must turn away from the bloodless absolutes and spiritually empty delusions. I believe when he spoke of this he directly meant anything outside of our own traditional and cultural beliefs. If we are to find a future , we must at least in some respects , turn back to the old .
