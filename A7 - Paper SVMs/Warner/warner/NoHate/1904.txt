I agreed with the poster. Asian-Americans have had their sense of their self worth destroyed and want White acceptance as a form of self affirmation. I have seen Asian women married to white men who now have mixed children. Their children do not identified with being Asian and they tell their Asian mother they wo n't date minority men. These Asian women have no sense of themselves and ca n't even guide their children to accept the most basic aspects of themselves. I ca n't even have a conversation with these women , they are an embarrassment to me and they ca n't even have the most basic conversation about their racial identity in the context of historical and contemporary racial politics .
