@ no_slappz : I think that this so called Freedom of Speech is very subjective. Is it freedom to burn religious books. Maybe for some. Try saying something against Israel and see what happens to your " freedom " . They will kick you out of your job and black ball you ! Think about it . Anyhow , I do agree that it is best to ignore people like Terry Jones. He wants to inspire discord between peoples. We should n't give him the pleasure. Let him worry about the state of religion in an increasingly areligious Western society. Christianity has become more of less irrelevent for the majority of so called Christians in the West. Maybe this is what really bothers Terry Jones.Recommend
