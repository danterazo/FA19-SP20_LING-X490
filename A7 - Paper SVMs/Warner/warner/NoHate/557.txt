A student in the United States was recently suspended from High School after wearing a T-Shirt with the message " Homosexuality is shameful ( Romans 1 : 27 ) " on the back , written on tape and stuck to the shirt. The opposing side of the shirt read , " Be ashamed. Our school has embraced what God [ sic ] has condemned. " The student wore the shirt to school the day after a " day of silence " was held in support of non-heterosexual students .
