i am not sure * what * my stand is on speech... my concern is that if governments get into the business of regulating speech - governments , being what they have been , for like forever , are going to be most interested in protecting their own interests and the interests of the nt group. while doing things to protect minority and historicall down-trodden groups truly is a noble goal - i fear that such power would , more than likely , be subverted and misused for other reasons...as a citizen of the US , i feel many of my rights are in jeopardy as it is - i am not so quick to give many away.. .
