I am not white trash. I am probably one of the most open minded people in terms of cultural appreciation that I know. I have an incredibly diverse group of friends from every corner of the globe and I love them all and embrace their cultures with an open heart , ears , eyes , mind and stomach . I hate what the general population in China has become. That is not because I am racist - it is because of what I have seen and experienced and what they have become .
