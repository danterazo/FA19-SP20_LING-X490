The third thing I hate about Asians is how apathetic many of them are in terms of honor these days. If I saw an Asian being stereotyped in a movie theater , I would immediately stand up and shout incessantly at the screen so that none of the white audience members could enjoy the film. When I saw a white man yelling at an old Asian woman a few months ago , I walked up to him and hollered slurs right back in his Aryan face. But most other Asians , I am disappointed to say , would rather just chuckle at their own stereotypes on screen and ignore the problems of their brethren. At the risk of sounding corny , whatever happened to the days of the samurai ? When honor meant more than life ? Whatever happened to the age of Sun Tzu when we used to kick ass ?
