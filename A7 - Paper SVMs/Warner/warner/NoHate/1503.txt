To cite a favorite passage : " Death is a cool night and it sings a beautiful German melody by Johannes Brahms. Although the sun bestows life on its own , the night allows the trees and plants to grow. Only the moon , the stars and the animals are witnesses to this miracle. ...the Argonauts...wanted to put their increasingly divine nature to the test . This spiritual growth was quite comparable to the development of trees...we have to be rooted to the earth , to the Mother , to grow upward in the light and stretch ourselves up to the stars. "
