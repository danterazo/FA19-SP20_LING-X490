In 1945 , four out of five American newspapers were independently owned and published by local people with close ties to their communities. Those days , however , are gone. Most of the independent newspapers were bought out or driven out of business by the mid-1970s. Today most " local " newspapers are owned by a rather small number of large companies controlled by executives who live and work hundreds or even thousands of miles away. Today less than 20 percent of the country 's 1,456 papers are independently owned ; the rest belong to multi-newspaper chains. Only 103 of the total number have circulations of more than 100,000. Only a handful are large enough to maintain independent reporting staffs outside their own communities ; the rest must depend on these few for all of their national and international news .
