There is indeed an election going on , and while the Daily Raider supports Mary Cal Hollis ( Ralph Nader ai n't hardcore enough for our commie asses ) , we 're a journalistic source , dammit , and as such we 've given webspace to two editorials by the leading presidential candidates. Bob Dole and Bill Clinton each give their takes on why we oughta let them run the empire . Fuck getting something from Ross Perot. It 'd just be gibberish .
