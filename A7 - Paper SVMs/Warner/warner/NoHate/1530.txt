Another popular taunt in the world of Halo 2 is fondly known as " teabagging. " When you kill a guy ( because of course we 're all guys , even when I play ) , you squat over his bleeding head as if you 're dunking your big cybertesticles in his mouth. Then you say something like , " Oh yeah , you want it , do n't you ? " I know it sounds gross , but it 's actually funny . Maybe you have to be there .
