Islam is not about right and wrong thinking but correct behaviour. If one imitates the behaviours of Mohammed , then one is observant and submissive. Morality is not a part of Islam. If there is a more fundamental difference between Islam and all other creeds and religions I do not know of it. It is so alien that the reader will have to consider its implications for some time to grasp the full meaning of it .
