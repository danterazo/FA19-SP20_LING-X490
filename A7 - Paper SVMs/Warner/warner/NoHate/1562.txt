When Christ was twelve years old , He , His mother and Joseph ( His foster father ) went down to Jerusalem. He became separated from them. Do you know where they found Him ? In the temple , confounding the wise men and the scribes ; He knew more than they did. He was expounding to them the mysteries of the Scriptures , for He has put them together. From that time on , Christ was busy on these things. Oh , you say , He was working in the carpenter shop ? He lived in the City of Nazareth ? Not very much. You want me to prove that to you ? Joseph of Arimathea owned the tin mines of Cornwall in Britain and , being of the true stock of the Kingdom of Israel , he was one of the most powerful members of the Sanhedrin. His ships ploughed up and down the coasts of Europe , through the Pillars of Hercules , and in the Mediterranean. Joseph was a good man ; he laid Jesus in his tomb. This is a matter of history. You can go to Rome today and see where Joseph paid constant duty from one country to another .
