Lauren : Have you , or anyone you know , ever " slept " with a " monkey " ? And are you aware at all that " homo sapiens , " that 's us , even if we may not really qualify for " knowing " or " knowledgeable. " Awareness of others or otherness ? Not apely likely. Fears and loathings are common to ALL , including " monkeys , " and well may the latter be fearful of " our " likes . Ewwww. Indeed. P.S. : And all you who hoot and holoer at " whites " out there , are n't you forgetting something ? Such as " tolerance , " forget " understanding " that there but for the grace . . .
