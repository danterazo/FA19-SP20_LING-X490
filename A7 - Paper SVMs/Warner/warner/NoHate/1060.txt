Firstly , enough with the dolphins already. If the Japanese wish to eat dolphins who are you to condemn them for it ? Indians revere cows as " holy " due to their relationship with their Hindu deities and beef is strictly prohibited. But do you care ? ( personally I eat beef too and I do n't have my Indian friends condemning me for it )
