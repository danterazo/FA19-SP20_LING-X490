If terrorism was an official American Cold War brew , it was turned into a local Sierra Leonean or Angolan or Mozambican or Afghani brew after the Cold War. Whose responsibility is it ? Like Afghanistan , are these countries hosting terrorism , or are they also hostage to terrorism ? I think both .
