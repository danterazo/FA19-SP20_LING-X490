After barely searching into this issue , I found a clip on the BBC News website. I was stunned. I was sure it was the alcohol teasing out these words from his mouth , but no , he actually found it in his dark labyrinth of a human heart to say the words that he said. It was so discriminatory that it was not even laughable ; it was an outrage and a disgrace , and for all of it to happen on our beloved Beeb - a tragedy .
