Ultimately we see that this doctrine of suicide bombing has nothing to do with true religion and that it is dangerous to the umma as well as the world. [ And I 'm saying this as a non-Muslim. ] There are those who want to say that suicide bombs against civilians are legitimate in one arena ( Israel ) but not legitimate elsewhere. But this is n't the kind of doctrine that can be controlled. Having used the tactic so much in Israel , we are now seeing that it is being applied in the Arab world as well -- in Morocco , Indonesia , Egypt , Iraq , Saudi Arabia , etc .
