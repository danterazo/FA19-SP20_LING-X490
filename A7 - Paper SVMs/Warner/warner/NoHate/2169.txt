Promising - but not for Hate Speech laws. To successfully charter and empower such a community would be itself a sign that we 've transcended some of the deep divisions we have. We 're far from there yet. Since we are proposing a law , one that will coercively suppress some speech , the political act of chartering such a community and selecting its members would be , well - poisonous. Since this community would have the power to enforce limits on what can be said and what ca n't be said , it 's selection would be spectacularly divisive. Some order of magnitude greater than the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. What " expertise " would be required ? Who exactly would be defined as marginalized groups. What would their relative weight and representation be ? Would only marginalized groups have the right to appoint their members , and would the prior speech of proposed community members be scrutinized ? Do we want activist , radical theorists , or proponents of assimilation ? It would be ugly - if you think we have too much hate speech now , just wait .
