All of the games are set in the modern world , although slightly in the future ; around the date 2012 , intentionally used for its apocalyptic connotations. You play as the American Desmond Miles , who is kidnapped by Abstergo Industries ( Abstergo , the Latin for " I cleanse " ) . The corporate and ` everywhere-but-nowhere ' image of this group characterises it as a cabal aiming at world domination. However , it is the historic basis of the game which has interested so many , as - like The Da Vinci Code - it fuses history , modernity , fact and fiction fluidly. Abstergo Industries is revealed as a front organisation for the descendants of the Knights Templar ; and Desmond Miles , a descendant of a prominent member of the Assassin Order .
