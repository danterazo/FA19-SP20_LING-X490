Some are walking , some are talking , some are stalking their kill You got social security , but that do n't pay your bills There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay So you bargain with the Devil , say you 're o.k. for today You say that you love them , take their money and run Say , it 's been swell , sweetheart , but it was just one of those things Those flings , those strings you 've got to cut So get out on the streets , girls , and bust your butts
