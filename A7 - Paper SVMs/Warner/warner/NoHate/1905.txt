Berry : Is it not true ? Why does it take the KKK to come to these towns to get people to come together , Black and White , to talk about their problems and unite ? Why do n't the leaders of towns provide a forum for people to discuss their problems ? It costs them a lot of money ; that 's why. It also costs them a lot of money to have The Klan rally in a town . It cost Cleveland about a half million dollars. The corruption in these towns is so large that they rather have the money so it can be given away , under the table as gifts , kickbacks , or favors .
