And when you look in my eyes , please know my heart is in your hands It 's nothing that I understand , but when in your arms you have complete power over me So be gentle if you please 'cause your hands are in my hair , but my heart is in your teeth , baby And it makes me want to make you near me always Your hands are in my hair , but my heart is in your teeth , baby And it makes me want to make you near me always
