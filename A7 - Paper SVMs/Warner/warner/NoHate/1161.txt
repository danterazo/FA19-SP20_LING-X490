Prior to the collapse of communism some limited numbers of Russian Jews were allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union if they could prove they had Jewish descent , [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and criminals took advantage of this if they were themselves Jewish , acquiring Jewish identity papers to be granted the permission to leave the country that had been granted by Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s. [ citation needed ] According to a report , 573,000 refugees , mostly Jews , evangelical Christians and Catholics , have resettled in the US since 1975. As of 2001 , the Russian Jewish community in the US was estimated as being between 750,000 and 1 million ( and twice as high by some other estimates ) , while " an estimated 1 million more Jews immigrated to Israel " during the collapse of the USSR.
