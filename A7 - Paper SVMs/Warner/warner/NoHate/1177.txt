You sound resentful and confused. I understand how you feel. The world is a mirror of our own darkest selves. When we are confused within , all our own failures appear in phantom " others " and this blinds us to the real pressing dangers to society and our sustained well being. When we are calm , when we remember how to face sadness and pain without fear , we see in others what is best in ourselves. This morning it was sunny here , then the clouds came , and the rain. Soon it will be spring. Since you are also concerned about religion , perhaps you will understand me .
