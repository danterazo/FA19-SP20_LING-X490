A notable story within the pages of the first chapter related the concern of Zoroaster over the Aryan minority , who were the ruling majority at the time , and the original development of the idea that took hold of the west in the past century. This idea was protection of race by endogamy within kin. Since the aristocracy was widely scattered Zoroaster attempted to further reinforce the imperative through an ideologically bound community of faith. The truly Nordic beliefs of Zoroaster are revealed though through the concepts of struggle. In this , man must see himself as the struggling bearer of a world preserving idea , what he sows he reaps , he is always true to himself , and a handshake is an inviolable oath .
