Nathan Bedford Forrest initially accepted a post with the Union Army , but joined confederate forces when fighting hit close to home. The immediate safety of his family was his primary concern. Later , as the leader of the Ku Klux Klan , he required all Klansmen to pledge allegiance to the U.S . Constitution. The point being that the reason for fighting on either side was n't always as clear cut as we would believe. The early Klan was n't engaged in fighting " northerners " , but rather scoundrels with an elitist attitude - some who came from the North and some who came from the South .
