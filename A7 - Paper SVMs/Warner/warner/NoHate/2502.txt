The USA is still the worst example in the world of perverted laws that require teachers to show children how to verbally fellate flags every morning. It is a group orgy of fetishism in government schools ( socialist schools ) every day for 12 years of their lives. It has produced generations of Americans who are not libertarian , but are authoritarian libertines ( the libertine trait is not necessarily bad , the authoritarian trait IS necessarily bad ) .
