In practice , the new arrangement makes it much easier for Muslim countries to dictate what stays on the internet and what does n't. The removal of the material about " terrorism " was just muscle-flexing ; there is much more of that kind of censorship coming. If this stands , anti-jihad sites like my own site AtlasShrugs.com and the JihadWatch.org site run by my colleague Robert Spencer will likely lose their domain names. It will become harder and harder to find the truth about jihad activity , or any resistance to it , on the internet or anywhere else.. .
