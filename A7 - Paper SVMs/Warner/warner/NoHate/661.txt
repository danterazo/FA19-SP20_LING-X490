These are religious people , who 's done drugs , and or hired prostitutes in the past. Jim Bakker , George W. Bush ( Cocaine ) , Larry Craig , Newt Gingrich , Ted Haggard , Jimmy Swaggart , Rush Limbaugh , etc... the list is endless. As you can see being religious or even coming from a religious background does not make your more moral. What 's about Carl Rove ? He 's been on the conservative side for a while , yet hides the fact that he 's agnostic .
