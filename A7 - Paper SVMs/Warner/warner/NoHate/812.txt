Berry : Welfare is there for people who need it. They should get it. But the mamma should be checked to see if she 's going to Bingo halls and using the money on drugs. If tax money is being spent to support her drug habit instead of taking care of her kids , then she does n't need it. A good thing should n't be abused. I believe that a person over the age of 55 should n't have to pay taxes. They paid taxes for over 30 years of their life. It would make this a better world .
