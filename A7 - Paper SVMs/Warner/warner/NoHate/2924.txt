People in Nazi Germany had to carry an identity cards , but Jews had special identifying marks : a red " J " stamped on them and new middle names for those who did not have obviously " Jewish " first names : " Israel " for males , " Sara " for females. The cards allowed the police to identify Jews easily. The Daily Mail of 26th September reported on our new EU I.D.Cards. The Home Secretary claims " the cards would protect against identity fraud , illegal working , and help people prove their identity easily " but like the Nazi I.D.Cards foreigners will not have to show them to get a job or use the NHS and schools. The cards are covered in EU lettering and an EU symbol of a bull .
