I only hate how Asians are constantly try to be like us ( whites ) . For real , this is why I love going to places like Cambodia or Laos. The people there just do n't give a shit about whites ! Then , I go to Singapore. That 's a whole different story ! Everyone there tries to ape the Western lifestyle , politics and culture. It 's really pathetic that they ca n't see past the wool over their eyes ( the wool being a colonial mentality , where the colonizer 's culture is viewed as superior to your own ) .
