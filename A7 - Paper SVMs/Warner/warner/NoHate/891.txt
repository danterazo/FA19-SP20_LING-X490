I agree with Mike. And with Canada 's greatest defender of free speech , Defense Counsel Douglas Christie , who says : " It 's a funny thing about free speech : It ca n't be just for your political friends. If freedom means anything , it is the one valuable gift you have to give to your worst enemies , in order to keep it for yourself. " http : //www.douglaschristie.com/
