My GF just started job on a pyramid scan selling water purifiers , it 's kind of like Scientology but with water purifiers. She wo n't believe me . Can you smite pyramid scammers even if you have to take down the GF ? It 's time for a new one anyway. Having to agree with her about this for the sake of some pre-marital sex makes me feel dirty .
