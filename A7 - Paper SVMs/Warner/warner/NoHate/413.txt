I find that you 're very narrow minded and a hipocritical individual. You wrote you 're article in English , might as well write in your own damn language. Based on what you wrote , I say that you trying to be American . First of all it 's not only the asian race that are influenced by other cultures , but you 've made me come to realize that not everyone have enough common sense to understand that. You sound like intelligent individual with your words , but I wonder why an intelligent individual would come up with such a senseless conclusion. Maybe you 're just like every that you decribed , trying to sound smart when in reality your just another retard. Save yourself from embarrassment and close your mouth until you have anything better to say. I 'm not writing this because I 'm defending my race , but it sickens me when I see ignorant people like you . I do n't confine myself within my race like you do , instead I define myself as my own person working my way up in the world and adapt to my own environment. In my job , I destroy people like you everyday. Yes , I am comparing you to a terrorist. There is no room for people such as you , in this world , so do yourself a favor ; learn or just roll over somewhere and die. That Is all .
