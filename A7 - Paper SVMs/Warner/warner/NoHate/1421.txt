As for those cartoons , I think they were a clear incitement and provocation of at the least anger on the part of Muslims worldwide. The basic truth is that the west has ideals , such as freedom of speech , that the rest of the world does not understand or share , and we simply do n't understand why these things have caused such an upset. It 's just a cartoon , we say , but to Muslims , it is a complete disregard of their religion and culture , and a disrespect of the millions of Muslim people who want to lead peaceful lives. I think the answer certainly is not to react with such violence , and it is better to sit down and discuss it , but I do n't think that means they should just " get over it " and adopt western frameworks. It seems to me that most western representations of this situation do n't concede that meeting halfway means we also have to take steps toward that middle point - that would mean giving up our precious freeomd of speech in some small way ! I am certainly not condoning the violence and hate speech that has been the response in so many parts of the world - here in Halifax we had a peaceful demonstration of about 200 Muslims at the Danish embassy - but I am also not going to say western political freedoms should rule all and others should just get over it. I think the cartoons were hurtful , and deliberately so , and given the unrest going on globally within the Muslim community , the cartoons were also irresponsible and provoking. There has to be some accountability !
