17. The percentage of mixed marriages for whites , AT A GLOBAL LEVEL , is probably the highest. The high rate in South Korea makes little sense , but if true , is mostly mixed marriages with other orientals. A korean with a vietnamese is probably like a greek with a swede...not racially mixed. Racially mixed marriages are almost non existent in east asia .
