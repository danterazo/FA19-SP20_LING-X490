I 'm sure this person and the one hopelessly off beat behind the camera thought they were cool for actually filming ignorance...first hand. I could say that hopefully years down the line they will see themselves and see how asinine they were at the time , as most folks do when they get older and look back on themselves , but...judging from the age they seem to be now...and how adamant they were to post this...I do n't believe they will ever be astute enough to come full circle and sweep up the mess they made .
