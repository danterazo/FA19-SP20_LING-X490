In the spring of 1923 , the Klan went to the state assembly to support a bill to permit New Testament readings in public schools. ( Such was not considered a violation of the separation of church and state at the time. ) Later that summer the Klan and the Ministerial Association of Plainfield joined in opposition to Sabbath breaking. Some ministers preached that the Klan was the only hope of bringing straying Christians back into the fold , and the Grand Dragon promised that he would strive to return New Jersey to " The Old Time Religion " . In the village of Atco , near Camden , the Klan participated in the dedication of a new non-denominational church. Throughout the 1920 's , the relationship between Klan and clergy continued. Klansmen and churchmen joined to sponsor Senator Heflin for president at a rally at Upsala College. In Atlantic City , the extremely active local Klansmen accused the city government of protecting vice and lawlessness. The Klan took part in the Flag Day parade in Bloomfield. In 11926 , the Unity Klan No. 17 of Rahway and Linden sponsored a fund raising drive to rebuild the Negro Church of Carteret. The banner on photo below reads : " Help Us To Rebuild The Negro Church Of Carteret " .
