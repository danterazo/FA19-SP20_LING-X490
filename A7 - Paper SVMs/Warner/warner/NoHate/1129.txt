There are many examples of ancient literature that can be found concerning Thule , belonging to many different cultures and societies but all being remarkably similar. The earliest known account would be from the Greek explorer Pytheas from his now lost work On the Ocean , written about his travels between 330 and 320 BCE. Another account comes from Strabo , circa 30 CE , who mentions that the exact position of Thule is unknown to him , but it is out of all named and known countries , the furthest North. Half a century after Strabo , Pliny the Elder publishes his Natural History and writes " The farthest of all , which are known and spoke of , is Thule ; in which there be no nights at all , and we have declared , about mid-summer when the sun passes through the sign of cancer ; and contrariwise no days in mid-winter : and each of these times they suppose , do last six months , all day or all night. " Finally , he refines the islands location as being near the Sycthian parallel , from the Rhiphean hills .
