Never mind that everything in it has been proven true , time and again . What matters is that some jewish feelings got hurt. The truth hurts. But it should n't hurt the truth teller. Unless the truth being told is about jews , goes the new/old conventional wisdom , then the rules are different , just as we see around the world , day after day. Recently , in " Tell a Joke , Go to Jail < http : //www.conspiracypenpal.com/columns/rant.htm > " ( http : //www.conspiracypenpal.com/columns/rant.htm ) , I wrote about a law which had been passed by Hungary 's democratically-elected Parliament which stipulated a two-year prison term for " someone who publicly insults a Jew. " ( http : //www.fpp.co.uk/online/03/12/Hungary_FreeSpeech.html ) What 's more , if the insult amounted to an expression of " hatred , " the sentence went up to three years ! Fortunately , at the last moment , Hungary 's President declined to sign the bill. It will be back , though , and it will be passed eventually .
