* The GOP is effectively The White People 's Party. Whites cast some 90 percent of total Republican votes , and the party 's 2010 national victory was primarily the result of outstanding White participation. * In the current multiracial environment , in which minorities consistently vote Democrat , major Republican victories occur when the party 's percentage of White support greatly outstrips that of the general ( multi-racial ) population. * Over the past 40 years , Hispanic voting has been remarkably structural and intractable. The GOP 's " outreach " efforts consistently fail , and there 's little evidence that Hispanics would flock to a " Latino-friendly " GOP. * The GOP could unite a substantial majority of White voters by focusing its platform on immigration restriction. * A successful Republican strategy would be to " reach in " to its Majority base rather than " reach out " to Minorities. The GOP should not shirk its real identity ; it should embrace it .
