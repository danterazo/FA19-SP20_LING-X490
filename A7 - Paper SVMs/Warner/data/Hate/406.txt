Of course in the Fourth Reich this would be a Universal Military Training which would be one aspect of encouraging a maximum labour shortage so that those men who truly had a good reason to work hard would then be able to achieve their goals through the noble dignity of labour. Guarding the borders and structures of the Aryan State against judaic subversion would also be a key element in providing employment for men. This also fits in with another excellent reason for men to respect Aryan womanhood : not only are home-making and child-rearing absolutely necessary for Aryan civilization , but they also help to increase a healthy labour shortage which would also greatly benefit the laymen to earn a good living and thereby better afford the heavy costs of raising a family .
