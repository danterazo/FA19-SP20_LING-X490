The sad reality is that the local authorities are creating this situation by allowing it to develop. On Sunday nights on Broad Street in Birmingham a local bar put on R&B nights. This music is very popular with young Blacks and the gangstas and this city-centre venue caters for them. The door staff have to be changed as they would be targets walking through the streets and would be waited for outside for even minor transgressions like not letting certain people in. They are replaced by Black door staff from a different area. It is being changed to a " members only " event to prevent innocent people blundering in and being beaten. They have knife arches outside to detect metal and only serve drinks in plastic not glass. White women go there but it would not be safe for White men .
