Alan Berg , an extremely arrogant and outspoken kike of a radio show host based in Colorado , was number two on the Order 's list of those that had to go. David had apparently called in a couple times and had arguments with the talk show host on the air , which was probably his first mistake . Ultimately , when the task was carried out , David was the driver . Considering the repercussions of this act , I would personally say that it was not worth it considering the loss of such active men devoted so much to our cause versus the loss of a single stupid Jew. To me , the gain did not outweigh the loss in that particular situation .
