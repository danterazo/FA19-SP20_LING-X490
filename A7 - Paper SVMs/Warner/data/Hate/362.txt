Doubt anything in our modern world , scoff at sacred texts , no-one will care - except that one kind of doubt is forbidden to you , which will land you in jail - in ten different nations ! You can read the Hammer-horror account in , e.g. , Auschwitz by Lawrence Rees ( 2005 ) : every hour or so , a thousand naked Jews were marched ( somehow ) into a room with space for maybe one or two hundred , the doors are locked , then the Zyklon-B is poured down special chutes or holes in the ceiling ( which did not exist in the war , they were added later ) , then after the screaming stops ` powerful fans ' remove the poison gas. In your dreams , Mr Rees. There were no such powerful fans. But , then what ? The mass of bodies will be mixed up with the Zyklon-B , and that is specifically designed to keep emitting the cyanide gas slowly. How is anyone supposed to shovel out this tortured mass of corpses mixed up with poison powder ? Remember there are only ordinary-sized doors , mostly opening inwards. Its an unthinkable nightmare that could not possibly have worked , and would certainly have gassed any workers trying to operate it. It is the ` safe ' design of this insecticide material , which would have prevented it from functioning in this deliriously-imagined manner .
