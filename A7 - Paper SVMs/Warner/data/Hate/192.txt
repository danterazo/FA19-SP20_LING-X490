Starkey never blamed race for the problems as the elites blame Whites . They are racist against Whites. Racism hopes to blame problems on a racial scapegoat. If the Hutus have a bad crop , it must be because of the Tutsi ; if there are race riots in England it must be because of White racism. Nationalism says that our most basic form of political order is advanced tribalism : people are united by culture , heritage , language , customs , values and descent from ancestors not political ideology , like " capitalist democracy " versus " socialist authoritarianism , " Rule of Law ( which they are suspending to cope with problems of immigration ) . There are currently 20,000 diseased Africans in this country with AIDS but the elites never any health warnings to young girls not to sleep with them . That is both irresponsible in failing to protect the innocent and also shows hatred for their own ordinary people .
