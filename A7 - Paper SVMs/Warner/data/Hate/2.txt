For the devout Muslim there is no place for conscience , compassion or empathy , only mobotic behavior patterns programmed by a long-dead psychopath. There is no morality to be had in Islam. There is consequently no Golden Rule ( 'Do not do to another that which would be hurtful to you ' ) [ Ed- a point we ourselves have brought up on this blog ] or any other higher ethical principles. There is nothing apart from a huge number of prescribed regulations which must be obsessively and compulsively observed. Hence the lack of originality and creativity in the Muslim world. The Ummah has effectively only one brain for 1.2 billion people and that brain belongs to Mohammed .
