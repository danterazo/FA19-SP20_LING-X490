HMMMMMM , uh was n't gandhis struggle against british oppression , not only lager in scale , but lasted longer ? from 1891 to 1947 , thats how many years ? 56 if my math is correct. How many years did the civil rights movement last ? 1955 to 1968 thats how many years ? 13 if my math is correct. Once again you have your facts turned around and upside down . Its called a history book , pick one up and read it , maybe you 'll learn something. Their has been oppressed people since the beginning of recorded history , so come down off the cross we need the wood. The black people were not the most oppressed poeple on the entire planet , as you would have us believe. They just complain about it more than any other race on the face of the planet. Let me ask you this , What was it like to be a slave ? Cant answer that can you. do you know why ? YOU WERE NEVER A FUCKING SLAVE , YOU HAVE HAD FAR MORE PRIVILEGES AVAILABLE TO YOU THAN THE GENERATIONS BEFORE YOU ! Yet here we are listening to you complain about how oppressed you are. Well , theres a simple solution if you do n't like it here. LEAVE , go back to you beloved african nation and see how good you have it there. As far as racism goes , why does n't the United Negro College Fund give scholarships to whites ? But every other scholarship commitee in the country bases their awards on merit , not skin color . Racist ? Seems so to me. But you do n't want to talk about that do ya. It 's not racism if it works to your races advantage , but let someone exclude a black person , and holy shit weve commited a major atrocity. Grow up , get a job , quit dragging up the same old rhetoric we 've been hearing for the last 40 years. Get over it. your not a slave , you 've never been a slave , you probably could n't even name a member of your family that has been a slave , so stop your crying .
