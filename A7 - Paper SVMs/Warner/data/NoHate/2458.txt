I have just learned of the anti-Israel ad campaign that has been launched in 18 NYC subway stations by twopeoplesonefuture.org. I am contacting you to express my strong disapproval with this ad campaign. The campaign is supported by the anti-Israel lobby , whose agenda is not peace but the destruction of the State of Israel. Second , it unfairly penalizes Israel for defending itself. New York City should not allow these types of ads to be run in our Transit System
