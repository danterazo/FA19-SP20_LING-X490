WKKK chapters competed among one another to bring Protestant values to the public schools. When one WKKK klavern presented a Bible to every public school in the township , another donated a Bible to every school in the county , or a flag and a Bible to every school. Some schools received copies of Stories of the Bible together with their flags and Bibles . Others received multiple copies of new Bibles for the use of their students or placards with the Ten Commandments for every schoolroom . ( page 144 )
