i live in america. i did n't ask to be born here anymore than you asked to be born on the set of " temple of doom " . i did n't vote for bush. i do n't watch american idol. i do n't like crappy movies. i read books with big words. i do n't give a crap about britney. i do n't even know who sanjaya is...could n't pick him out of a lineup. i know how to use computers. i do n't need some crappy call center job , either...so , you can take them. i would never engage in incest for any reason. obvious not a jerry falwell fan. it would seem your vague generalizations that all americans are the way you say we are is basically just a prejudiced , bitter , uneducated point of view to have-no matter how smart you are otherwise. care to amend ?
