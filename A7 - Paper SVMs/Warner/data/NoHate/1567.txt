In addition , for those who wish to rebut me with the whole " dolphins/whales are sentient " argument etc. I would like to point out that you are simply splitting hairs. As long as an animal can feel pain , its bad enough.

Now I present to you , a severely mentally challenged man. He is unable to form concepts of family , life goals etc .
