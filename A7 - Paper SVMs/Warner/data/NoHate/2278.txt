To put it another way : It 's one thing to preach and practice tolerance , and respectfully disagree with homosexuals about the morality of their sexual conduct while accepting their worth as human beings , as friends , or as political allies. It 's quite another to preach that their sexual conduct has no moral significance. I think it 's plausible that a majority of college-educated conservatives subscribe to the first view. I 'm skeptical they subscribe to the second .
