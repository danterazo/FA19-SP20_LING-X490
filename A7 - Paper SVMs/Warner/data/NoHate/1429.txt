The labelling of innocent people as " racists " , " bigots " , " haters " etc. is dehumanisation setting us up for persecution for not conforming to establishment diktats. It is pure totalitarian thinking straight from Nazi Germany if any speak out against being dispossessed they are persecuted by the state. No man survives when freedom fails , The best men rot in filthy jails , And those who cry 'appease , appease ' Are hanged by those they tried to please. ___________________________ ( 1 ) http : //www.express.co.uk/posts/view/6562....workers-into-EU http : //www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fabric/maliprof.htm ; http : //www.express.co.uk/posts/view/6532....o-more-migrants http : //appablog.wordpress.com/2008/09/15/inauguration-of-the- migration-information-and-management-centre-cigem-in-bamako-mali-monday-6-october-2008/ http : //www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/thi....-uk-472164.html http : //www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/artic....n + workers + over + 'lazy + British ' , + says + CBI/article.do
