On September 1 , 2007 , on KGEZ-AM in Montana , John Stokes advocated that those who do not speak English should have their hands chopped off. He went on to pontificate that 'Romans 15 : 19 says that if they break into your country , chop off their leg. We have to forcibly get rid of them ! ' These statements clearly urge listeners to regard all Latinos-including their fellow citizens-as 'enemies ' and suitable objects of physical violence. [ Editor 's note : The Book of Romans , by the way , says nothing about leg chopping ; and needless to say our Jon Stokes had nothing to do with this commentary ] .
