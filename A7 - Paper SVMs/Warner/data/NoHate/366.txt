And then I thought , well , the next logical place I need to visit in order to observe absurdity in action are the Asian cremation videos. I mean , I already got the whole medical field is corrupt as hell thingamajig a long time ago. I think I got that when the politicians started to bitch about it , which in plain English means they were threatening the medical profession with being nationalized if they do n't cough up more campaign cash. It 's just a shakedown , and basically this is prolly why the medical profession is such a pile of shit - to the extent that basically the crematoria are working overtime in America , which would make Auschwitz look like a walk in the park. Oh yeah , right here in America , the medical establishment could n't care less if any of us croak or not , as long as the remains are gotten rid of - period .
