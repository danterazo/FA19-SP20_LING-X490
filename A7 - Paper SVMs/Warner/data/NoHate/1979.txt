Birmingham Chief Constable Chris Sims announced at a press conference on 20th August : " I have taken the decision... perhaps an unusual decision ... I want to to release into the public domain... footage showing people firing into lines of police officers...evidence of several gunmen , evidence of a level of planning. What we are looking at is a concerted attempt to kill or injure police officers... it is also a threat to the wider community. " ( 2 )
