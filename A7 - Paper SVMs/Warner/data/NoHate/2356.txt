One of the most tangible expressions of Nazi interest in Tibet was the adoption of the deepest , most mystical , and most sacred symbol of the Nazi party , the swastika. Interpreted , the origin of the word is in Sanskrit , meaning good fortune or well being. The swastika is one of mankind 's oldest symbols apart from the cross and the circle , having been adopted by Egypt , India , China , the Navajo Indians , and Arab-Islamic sorcerers. The swastika was adopted by the NSDAP when a dentist named Dr . Friedrich Krohn suggested the idea. Krohn produced the original design for the actual form in which the Nazis came to use the symbol ( which would be reversed , and spinning in an anti-clockwise direction. ) As a solar symbol , the swastika is properly thought of as spinning .
