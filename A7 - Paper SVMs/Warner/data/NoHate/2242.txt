The followers of today 's post Christian faith declare they are believers of Jesus Christ. But what kind of Jesus do they believe in. Most misinterpret the scripture John 3 : 15 " That whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life " . The Jews believe in Jesus - that is they believe in the existence of a man named Jesus who is their adversary. But to have a belief in Jesus and to believe upon Jesus means to stand for the same principles he stood for. Very few Christians today believe or stand for the principles that Christ stood for .
