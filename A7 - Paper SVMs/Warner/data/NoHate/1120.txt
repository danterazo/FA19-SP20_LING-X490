To be fair to Senator Obama and his opponent , the Arab-American community is neither homogeneous nor united. It is split down many religious , socio-economical and cultural fault lines that go beyond the generational gap common to every immigrant community. In general terms , Lebanese ( also Syrian and Iraqi to a lesser extent ) Americans of Christian extraction form a distinct sizeable group who maintain strong links to their motherland but are keen to show themselves as ` faith cousins ' fully integrated to the American dream. Coptic Egyptians are a smaller but well organised group with a militant Christian streak. They are socially conservative on issues such as abortion , gay rights and the death penalty and feel comfortable in enlightened republican circles. Many Muslim Arabs of various origins are as socially conservative but find it harder to show their American credentials due to a heavier religious and cultural load. In some cases this extends to public expressions of faith ( The veil ) which for the insulated average American belong to the enemy. Their Arab identity is emphasised in relation to other Muslims but more recently the two groups have grown closer as a consequence of wholesale prejudice against them and the Islamisation of the Palestinian struggle . US intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan only served to confirm their beliefs in a conspiracy targeting the existence of their religion .
