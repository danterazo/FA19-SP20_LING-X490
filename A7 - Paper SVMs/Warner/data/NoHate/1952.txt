First , it 's not contradictory. My conceptualization of freedom has more to do with collective freedom from barriers imposed by oppression than with individualistic rights to do whatever one wants. Since hate speech causes harm and continues oppression in meaningful ways , it is a barrier to the freedom of the marginalized people being spoken about. I do n't see how a society can tolerate hate speech about any group and then argue that that group is able to participate in that society in any equal way .
