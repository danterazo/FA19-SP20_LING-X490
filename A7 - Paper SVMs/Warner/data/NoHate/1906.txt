The Thule Society was inevitably the mother to the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei ( DAP ) , otherwise known as the German Worker 's Party , for in 1919 two of its members , Anton Drexler and Karl Harrer founded it. In the same year , Adolf Hitler joined the DAP and by April 1 , 1920 the DAP was reconstituted as the National Sozialstische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei ( NSDAP ) , otherwise known as the National Socialist German Workers Party . This new name was equally intended to attract both nationalists and proletarians .
