The fifth Marquess of Salisbury wrote to Viscount Swinton in 1954 : " I should not be satisfied with the legislation which you suggest. I feel that it would only be tinkering with what is really becoming a fundamental problem for us all , though it is only beginning to push its ugly head above the surface of politics. The figures which we have been given make it clear that we are faced with a problem which , though at present it may be only a cloud the size of a man 's hand , may easily come to fill the whole political horizon ...With each year that passes , and with the general improvement with methods of transportation , the flow increases. Indeed , if something is not done to check it now , I should not be at all surprised if the problem became quite unmanageable in twenty or thirty-years time. We might well be faced with very much the same type of appalling issue that is now causing such great difficulties for the United States. "
