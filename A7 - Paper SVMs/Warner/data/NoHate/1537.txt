You might find my words rather distasteful and downright threatening , but lem me tell y'all something. It might well come to that. I 'm not ruling it out at all , because when push comes to shove and if this tit-for-tat goes on much longer , enough will be enough. And that 's when there are going to have to be some lessons learned about how far hateful assholes can push those who know history well enough to know that the winners write it. And the only winners there are in the history books are the ones who outlived the other ones who did n't get a chance to write it in the first place .
