Freedom from Harm Freedom is a delicate balance. A society can only support an individual 's rights so long as that individual does not infringe on the rights of another. In regards to hate speech , it is hard to understand why one person 's ( or group 's ) right to freedom of expression should trump the right of a group not to have hateful things said about them. Why should the rights of the haters be held above those of the victims of hate speech ? Societies that tolerate hate speech institutionalize that form of violence. When an individual is the subject of " hate " speech , he or she has the right to press criminal charges against the speaker ( s ) on the basis of slander/defamation of character . When a group is the subject of hate speech , it seems defenders of Section 2b of the CCRF would tell members of that group to just get over the slanderous comments , because the speaker ( s ) right to free expression is paramount .
