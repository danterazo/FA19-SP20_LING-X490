I really think as much as you may despise me , just because you think since I 'm black I 'll be like this... and will act like that... You should care to get to know people of different backgrounds for who they are , not what they look like and how you may think they act. I find it unimaginable to hate a whole race and I just think it 's too much energy that could otherwise be focused on something much more productive .
