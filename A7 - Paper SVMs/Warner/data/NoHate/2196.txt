Many Americans suffer from flag fetishism. Flag fetishism can be a sexual fetish , non-sexual , or alternating between the two. It is the most oddball flag fetishism in the world. Flag fetishism is so perverted in America that young children are taught to verbally fellate flags every morning in school classrooms. It is a form of brainwashing or Pavlovian conditioning that can influence youngsters years later in sexually active adulthood. America 's flag fetishism has grown so much that adults impose it upon children via government and laws that require daily chanting of the quasi-religious " Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag " ritual in government schools .
