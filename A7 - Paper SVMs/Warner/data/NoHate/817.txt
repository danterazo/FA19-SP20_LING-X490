Chinese in PRC behaves badly because of the crude nationalist and Communist propagandas fed on them in schools. 100 years ago the situation was different. Chinese used to believe in Confucian , Daoist and Buddhist philosophies were considered gentle , pushovers and weak people. That 's why European colonists known them as the " Sick man of Asia " .Mao Zedong and his communist party got rid of Chinese religions and made most Mainland Chinese aggrasive and ruthless. Mao accused Confusianism , Daoism , and Buddhism made chinese permissive , weak , and too tolerant . Actually those religions helped chinese to be spiritually strong. I was shocked to see mainland chinese lack spiritual values and gets involved in immoral activities .
