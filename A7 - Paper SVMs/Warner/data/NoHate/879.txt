Sure , the Southwest used to be Mexico. Not any more. It was taken from them. It 's ours by right of conquest , and I 'm not about to give it back . Besides , they took it from the Spaniards , who took it from the Indians , so using their line of thinking , it rightfully belongs to the Indians . And btw , the Mexicans are partly descended from the Aztecs , Mayans , and Toltecs. They were not descended from American Indian tribes. I dare some Mexican to go over to an American Indian reservation and tell those Indians that the Mexicans have a birthright to this land. They 'd probably break his face for that .
