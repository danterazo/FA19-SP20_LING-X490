Thus far in my probate-ship within the Knights of the Nordic Order , I 've written many reports. Until now I 've never been so nervous to write on any subject until I chose Sir David Eden Lane as the subject of this paper. How do you begin to " summarize " such a monumental life in only 3500 words ? It 's absolutely impossible. I also believe it 's impossible to explain the undying gratitude I will always have , in the very core of my heart and soul , towards this man for what he has done and for what he has given to our race and our people. This is the topic I 've chosen , however , so I hope to do him justice .
