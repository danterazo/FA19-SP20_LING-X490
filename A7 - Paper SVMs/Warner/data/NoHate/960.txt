The first Halo , which comes in both Xbox and PC versions , gets the story rolling. It 's 500 years in the future , and Earth 's colonies are being attacked [ whitespace ] by a coalition of religious-fanatic aliens calling themselves the Covenant. They decide that Earth people are not godly and start killing everybody with cool weapons like plasma rifles and needle guns. In the single-player version , which I 'm rather fond of , you play a souped-up soldier with mega-armor called Master Chief .
