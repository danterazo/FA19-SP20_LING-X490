How do these 'academics ' know that Starkey 's wrong when they have the " No Platform Policy " endorsed by the NUS , and their use of UAF thugs to silence politically incorrect speakers at universities ? Academic progress is supposed to be achieved by hearing opposing viewpoints ? If this find this type of Black culture is difficult to define , how do people know what to put in " Black History Month " or MOBO ? A classic example of their bias is that " academics " at the LSE have attacked him. Is this the LSE that took a -L-1.5 million bung from Saif Gadaffi for a plagiarised PHD and allowed him to deliver the Ralph Milliband memorial lecture on " Democracy in Libya " ?
