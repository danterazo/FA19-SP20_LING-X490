You can rationalise this all you want with claims that Ann Coulter did n't think that much about it. You 're right , she did n't - but this is still what she was doing. She just did n't know it. That 's the nature of cognition ; we often do n't know why we 've done things , but that does n't stop us explaining our reasons .
