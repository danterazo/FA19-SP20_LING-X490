I was privy to the extensive rap sheet maintained on Mr. Fein , his foreign mob bosses and their operations at J. Edgar Hoover 's FBI. Mr . Fein is well aware of this rap sheet and the FBI 's long-maintained operations. I know with certainty that if released by the FBI , whether partially or completely , it would be used as ongoing front-page headlines by the media , to bring down the entire Paul campaign before the primaries. Ron Paul already has a highly-respected constitutional scholar who is articulate , eloquent , passionate , and most importantly , trust-worthy , clean , and from outside the poisonous capital beltway. That person is Tom Woods. Paul does not need this man Fein. He does not need this glitzy-oily foreign lobbyist who stands in total contrast to Paul 's platform .
