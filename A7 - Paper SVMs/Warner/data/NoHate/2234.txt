The term " Racist " is not descriptive but inhibitive. It is to cow us while our society is transformed from a natural society to a Multi-Racial state. After the Second World War Nazi and Fascist were more coercive , but as the war receded Racist became more effective as it was universally pejorative and not restricted to old-fashioned ideologies. It is corporate elites who want cheap labour imported as well as outsourcing and they operate within the " tender idealism " pushed by politicians .
