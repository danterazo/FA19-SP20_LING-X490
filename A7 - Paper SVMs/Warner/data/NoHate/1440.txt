Berry : There are a lot of Klan members in key positions in society . That 's why there 's so much secrecy. Klan members all take an oath not to reveal the identity of other Klan members. If they want you to know , they 'll tell you. It 's okay for a police officer to belong to the NAACP or the Black Badge Police Society or any other Black organization and Hispanics can have a Hispanic Police Association but my God...a White Police Association ? Awww...that 's racism. We ca n't have that. Why ?
