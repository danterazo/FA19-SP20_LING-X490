The best known of the smaller media companies , DreamWorks SKG , is a strictly kosher affair. DreamWorks was formed in 1994 amid great media hype by recording industry mogul David Geffen , former Disney Pictures chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg , and film director Steven Spielberg , all three of whom are Jews. The company produces movies , animated films , television programs , and recorded music. Considering the cash and connections that Geffen , Katzenberg , and Spielberg have , DreamWorks may soon be in the same league as the big four .
