here is the deal. When Windows 2000 will be introduced , the hardware required to run it will be too expensive to buy in volume. While it may not be as big an issue with individual servers , it can be an issue with volume purchases. I bet many companies will either delay purchases or go for a more efficient OS than Win2K. Mohawk Software Windows 95 , Windows NT , UNIX , Linux. Applications , drivers , support. Unfortunately , if it were just a matter of expense , NT would be dead. What we really have is a corporate world headed by techno-phobes who buy what is big-named and not what works. If M $ made OSs like they played to the press , Win95 would have been the greatest OS ever made. J. J.
