Finally , it came time to build my Utility Diskettes. And it was now that I unfortunately had a total failure ! Almost immediately upon starting the function , I am getting an error message popup that says : An error occurred while copying system files. Utility disks can not be created. In Warp 4 , the original " Create Utility Disks " program was something called " bootdisk.exe " and created four utility diskettes using the original files on the install CD-ROM. Then , starting in fixpack 5 or so , IBM added a little check box on the second " Source Directory " screen which said " Use files from hard disk if they exist. " The reason for this was to use the most up-to-date file versions installed from fixpacks in creating the utility disks rather than the downlevel GA files. A great idea but a bug in the program prevented it from working if you checked the box. If you dont check the box , the 4 utility boxes are still created from the GA files like always. Apparently this bug is fixed in fixpack 12 for Warp v4. I suspect that the Create Utility Disks program in Warp Connect has a similar bug. Try it with the box unchecked and see what happens. If that does not help , look at the source directory for the utility disk files. Did you install from CD-Rom or diskettes ? Is the letter of the source drive correct or has it changed during your new installation ? Is the CD-ROM or install diskettes physically in the source drive ? The program will terminate if these things are wrong. I doubt that your video install method had anything to do with the create utility disks program. The program is basically pretty simple and just copies a lot of files .
