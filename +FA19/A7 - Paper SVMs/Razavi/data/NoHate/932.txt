Because the Letterman show like most shows late night is entirely scripted. Swhat I understand. It sounds like that it was a joke playing up the detox bit but he was acting spaced. They do a very good job of making everything look spontaneous but it is all scripted which , in a way makes the program more admirable if they can make it all look like it is just happening. Well,all I can say is that if this particular event was scripted it was a mistake on all who were involved in it.I remember being embarrased enough by it as a viewer and I cant even imagine those in the audience and how they must have felt trying lamely to laugh the whole thing off as a joke. It was THAT bad and I certainly wouldnt have purchased Phillips book ( which I can only assume was one of the prime reasons for his appearence ) after his display on the show. Plus,I distinctly remember paying close attention to Letterman and he didnt seemed pleased at all about the way Phillips was behaving.In fact he gave every impression ( at least to me ) of being downright ticked.
