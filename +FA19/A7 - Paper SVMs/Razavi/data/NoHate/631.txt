I have a firewall with everything inbound blocked except port 80. Are there There are more hacks today on port 80 then there were hacks on all ports 10 years ago. For example , if you are running Microsofts " Personal Web Server " , then there is a good chance that I can read any file on your system. For example , using a URL like advantage of the fact Microsoft interprets multiple dots like " . " as successive directories going up " / " ; most web servers that you run on Win95 dont check for this. Windows NT server is just as bad. If you install the latest IIS 4.0 and dont harden it completely , a hacker can probably break in. Even hardened servers can often be compromised by the .htr and RDO vulnerabilities. On UNIX servers , there are tons of CGI programs that can be exploited at this port. Most all the website breakins you here about are through firewalls with just port 80 open. For example , the supposedly " hardened " PCWeek hacking contest was exploited through just this manner. There are firewalls that do URL checking , you might consider one of these. You may also be interested in the intrusions listed at Of the 300 intrusions listed here that BlackICE detects , I would say about 50 of them are just for port 80. Robert Graham
