How lucky I am ! Today in my mailbox I recieved this song ! Imagine ! [ musical spam snipped ] No matter how many times I sang that letter , I couldnt NOT sing it to the tune of " Oh , Canada. " Of course , my brane is now tainted. I finally got a chance to listen to the Spy Fox theme song. Nothing I ever hear from this day forth will ever measure up. " I often wet my socks " Archimedes Plutonium , KING OF SCIENCE ! 11 ! 1 ! Before you buy .
