The seven-day story is an obviously carefully crafted , unified piece of poetry. The parallel I mentioned is : 1 : Light separated from darkness 4 : Lights ( stars ) in the sky 2 : seas separated from heavens 5 : fish and birds 3 : earth separated from seas 6 : land animals and then plants and then humans ( 1 ) Light ( 2 ) Many days later , the sun Oy. I remember this witticism from a college class on the old testament. Actually , you could read it as being rather sophisticated ; light is a much more general concept and phenomenon then the particular heavenly body called the sun , as even the ancients would have known , observing fire , lightning , the moon , the stars and the planets .
