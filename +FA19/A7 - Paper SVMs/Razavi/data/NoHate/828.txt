Every thing in the our universe has mass , right ? So , if my dreams exsist dont they have some weight ? What are you asking ? Seriously. If a dream you mean the image , then yes. I believe a theory ( not necessarily the theory ) is that REM somehow triggers images and that the mind puts them together. I dont think thats true , but I am nowhere near an expert. I think it is the brains way of " playing " . In any case , that dream is information. Think of it like a file on a computer. That file has weight in the sense that to store a file , you need to change the direction of te magnetic domains on a disk. I would imagine a brain stores information in a similar manner , so the information of a dream has weight , IMO. The concept of a dream , well , I dont think it does. it is like asking if happiness or sadness , success or failure have weight .
