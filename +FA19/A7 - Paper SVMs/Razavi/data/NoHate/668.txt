I am using Absoft Fortran77 4.4 for the Mac. It requires MPW , which isnt so bad. I am a little confused at their support for this software : when my organization purchased it for me , it came as a set of floppy disks with a very old version of MPW included. I was a little afraid I had bought something that they didnt care very much about. But they recently came out with a new version. Also , their tech support is responsive : I found a minor bug in their compiler ( optimizing a particular piece of code produced errors that it shouldnt have ) and their tech support responed to my email in only three ( 3 ) days. see ( web page says it supports G4 ! ) Troy. Is there a freeware Fortran compiler for the Macintosh ? - If not , what is available ?
