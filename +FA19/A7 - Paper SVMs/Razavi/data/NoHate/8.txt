You need a four-pole mini-plug on one end , and a digital DIN on the other , no big deal. Try asking Creative Customer Service about this at 1-800-998-1000. you are right about the Encore connection. Dave I have Creatives PC-DVD Encore , I am thinking of getting the SB Live Platinum and DTT2500 speakers. I think the SP/DIF output of the Encore plugs into the SP/DIF input of the DTT2500. That leaves its Digital DIN input free. But Creatives Web site has no reference to a Digital DIN output on the SB Live Platinum , only " Digital Out ( front & rear S/PDIF output ) " . So do I have to unplug the DVD and plug in the SB Live every time I want to switch from DVD to games ? The live-platinum/specs.html says : Expansion header for Optical Digital I/O card or Live ! ( tm ) Drive ( available separately ) So do I have to buy even more parts to connect these ? If anyone actually owns these three products and can explain how they plug together , I would really appreciate it. If anyone from Creative is reading , your web site does an APPALLING job of explaining how these three products plug together. = S Page William Gibson bibliography | loving Carmageddon ! | CHIC salute
