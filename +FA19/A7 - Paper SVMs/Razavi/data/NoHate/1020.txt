.Arguing once again for a sound fiscal policy that does not involve going into debt. In the meantime , prices have dropped , people are buying more and more , and inflation quickly follows. Deflation as a whole I see as a good , but unsupportable , thing. It allows for instant booms , which end up eating themselves , as we get back to inflation. Well no. often in a deflationary period , people wont start buying more things. For two reasons. Firstly , deflationary periods are usually accompanied by large periods of unemployment. And nobody is going to buy a new car if they may not have a job the next day ( especially pre-social safety net ) Secondly , In a deflation , while the prices may have gone down , it is likely that the next day , the prices will go down further , so whats the point in buying now , when you could put your money in a matress , and buy more things for the same money tommorrow ? The last great cycle of deflation was called the Great Depression. Hardly good times for the country. No , the last great cycle of deflation was called the late 80s/early 90s. Guy Norman Cognito .
