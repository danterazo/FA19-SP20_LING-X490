Just saw a posting on Suns web page and saw Staroffice for sale for 6.95. Actually the cd comes with three or four ports of the program. Is this collection of things worth getting for OS2 ? I seem to remember reading in the Linux groups that Staroffice ran slowly. Might be wrong though. Any comments ? My experience , with StarOffice , is that it loves memory ( I would guess you need at least 64 meg ) and CPU cycles ( runs pretty good on my P200 , but it does slow down sometimes ) . The biggest problem that I have with the program , is with the HELP , or lack of help. I have found that SO5.1 will do almost anything I want it to do , but , sometimes , it takes a LOT of fooling around just to find out HOW to do what I want. Hope this helps.
