One can formulate QM in other than 4 dimensions. There are interesting issues related to the renormalizability of gauge theories , however. Yes and in fact all the Field Theories we know ( i.e. the relativistic quantum theories ) have singularities only in 4 dimensions but are regular if the number of dimensions is not 4.
