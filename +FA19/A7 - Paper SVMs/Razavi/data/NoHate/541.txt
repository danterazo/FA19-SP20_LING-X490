I was thinking about this over the weekend. I was/am an NT developer. However , I am currently working on an OSS based project , FreeBSD and Linux , in doing so , my existence is ( for the time being ) 100 % Microsoft free. I feel liberated. I somehow feel that better all around. I am forced to wonder. When I was doing NT exclusively , I had been working in a Windows environment for some time. I originated in UNIX , started doing DOS stuff , then Windows , then NT. I found that Windows and NT was all I was used to. I resisted going back to UNIX. I didnt want to because " Windows NT " was the future. I rationalized why NT was better , I could argue with the best UNIX guys. Then it happened. I had to use FreeBSD and NetBSD to access a networked thin client. A dec shark. It was difficult to setup , net-boot packages always are. Then I started to remember how fun UNIX was and how much one could get done easily. I noticed all the good programs were running on Linux , and Linux emulation ( at that time I guess ) was not great. So , I started using Linux. That was 1996. ( I had seen Linux a few years earlier but it was too primitive then ) I currently do every thing except Windows developement on Linux. ( And I think wine will allow me to do NT development on Linux pretty soon ! ) I wonder how many NT developers would feel the same way , given the right opportunity ?
