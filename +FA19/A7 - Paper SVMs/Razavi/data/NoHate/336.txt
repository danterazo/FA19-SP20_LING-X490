PZ , I believe in evolution , I believe that species evolve over time , however , how does one make the leap from animal ( animal ) to man ? Isnt a man inherently distinguishable from an animal ? No. PZ , do you believe in a human soul ? No. Or if you personally dont believe in it , could there exist a possiblity that it does indeed exist ? Sure , it is possible. Of course , if people have them , why not clams ? Well , I have heard of Clam Casino smile I guess thats something clams have in common with people laugh As far as I know , clams do not express emotions , and do not have a higher faculty ? I think people differ from animals in many ways although there are some similiarities and common traits. The most important way I can think of that humans are different than animals is that we are much smarter ( everything else , including technology , comes from this ) . And thats a difference of degree only ; dolphins are much smarter than fish , but they are both still animals. Do Clams go to Heaven ? Do humans ? For that matter , do humans deserve to go to heaven ? Religion has actually convinced people that there is an invisible man , living in the sky , who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of 10 things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these 10 things , he has a special place full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever til the end of time.but he loves you.
