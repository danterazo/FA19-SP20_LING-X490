On 10/15/99 , AM , " Brent Davies " Re : Gartner Group nails coffin on linux : | Read the fine print at the bottom of the Gartner article : " Written = by | Microsoft " Are we looking at the same fine print ? What I read is , " Copyright IDG = Communications 1999. " Microsoft Web Letter is published by Microsoft. Additional editorial material supplied by Gartner Group , Inc. = A9 1999. Editorial supplied by Microsoft is independent of GartnerGroup = 20 analysis and in no way should this information be construed as a GartnerGroup endorsement of Microsofts products and services. . Yada , Yada , Yada. For a sample , see : If you meant , " Read between the lines " then thats what you should = 20 have said. I might actually agree with that comment. The Gartner Group is akin to that metalic clothes designer who = 20 predicted that MIR would crash into France during September of this year. IOW , they are not often right. -B
