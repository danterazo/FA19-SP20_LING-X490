On Mon , 18 Oct 1999 + 1000 , an entity calling itself " Christopher Smith " uttered the following : | Strange. OE is usable but is only nice to the user. it is not recipient | friendly at all. After all , it is function is mainly , in part , to write to | others. They have to read what you send. Yes I do realise this. However , I am simply unable to locate a viable | alternative. I have tried Agent and Gravity - the former of which I didnt | like at all and the latter of which was far too unstable. Just out of curiosity , what was it exactly that you disliked about Agent ?
