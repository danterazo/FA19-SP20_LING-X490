Hi group. I am trying to do some research on ley lines and chi energy centering around the hypothesis that both are made up of high frequency/short wavelength electromagnetic radiation. Does anyone think it either is or is not possible for atoms , elements , molecules and compounds to give off such radiation. Thanks for your help. Vern [ Al responded ] Look at a black body spectrum vs temperature and recant. [ Vern responded ] Do I take it you [ ] r [ e ] in the " is not " possible catagory. [ Richard Herring responded ] Is not. Do a search for " ultraviolet catastrophe " to see why. [ Verns latest response ] Thanks for the responses. I have tried to understand what you are saying. The web sites I visited seemed to indicate that all matter does give off electromagnetic radiation ( EMR ) however , when matter is heated the wave length of the EMR shortens to a point then begans to lengthen again. Is that right ? If so , what wave length of EMR does say an atom of hyrodgen , or a molecule of water give off at room temperature here on earth ? Thanks for putting up with my uneducated inquiries. Vern
