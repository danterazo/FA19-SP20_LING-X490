I looked at the Amek web site. This sounds like the box you are talking about. " The SYSTEM 9098 Dual Compressor/Limiter , designed by Rupert Neve , provides Compression , Limiting and Ambience controls on each channel. The two channels may be linked for stereo operation. " Does anybody know where I might be able to rent one of these in the Boston area ? Dr Fred Bashour reviewed that 9098 compressor/limiter unit and as I recall said the anti ambience feature only affects program above the threshold point and even with no compression going on. Apparently you have to set a low threshold point in order to have quiet material show up at all. His review was a while back in Pro Audio Review Do you have a " Toy Specialists " rental company in Boston ? They probably carry it.
