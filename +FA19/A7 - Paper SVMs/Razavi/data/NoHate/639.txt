I doubt it Rod. From what I have heard the mount is not rugged enough for that kind of work. I tend to believe those reports , since I had to go to a GP mount for my C5 in order to do CCD imaging , and the MX5-C camera I am using is one of the lightest and smallest on the market , so balancing it on my old ( and sold ) C5 + mount should not have been a problem , but the mount couldnt hack the tracking. In any case , unless the drive gears on the RA and Dec axis are made to high specs , I doubt they are precise enough to allow unguided or guided exposures through the G5. Just my two cents worth. As far as I know , there is only one drive , a single axis RA drive , available for this scope. Has that changed ? At any rate , I have found , in the couple of examples I have had a chance to observe with/play with that the drive is certainly sufficient for visual work , and could probably be pressed into service to take decent prime focus/planetary photos as well.
