I was able to access the Recent EQs site within 15-20 minutes and get the location and intensity info. Paul snip I couldnt get to the site for close to two hours. Then , when I finally was able to connect the maps would not show up although the list of quakes for the maps was updated just fine. There simply would be no map image displayed. I figured it was simply that the isps , relays , and other parts of the net were just swamped. Skywise
