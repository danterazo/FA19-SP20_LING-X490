Somebody can help me ? some my co-workers will go to Melbourne for Auspak 99 expo and i would ask them to buy-me astronomical material ( i.e. eyepieces , finderscopes , mirrors. ) if the prices are lower than in Italy. For this reason i must know before some shops addresses ( in Melbourne ) and the pricelist. Could someone tell me where I could find web site concerning these sellers. Thanks , Riccardo. ( from Ferrara-Italy )
