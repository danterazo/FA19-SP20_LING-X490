PZ , I believe in evolution , I believe that species evolve over time , however , how does one make the leap from animal ( animal ) to man ? Isnt a man inherently distinguishable from an animal ? No. PZ , do you believe in a human soul ? No. Or if you personally dont believe in it , could there exist a possiblity that it does indeed exist ? Sure , it is possible. Of course , if people have them , why not clams ? Well , I have heard of Clam Casino smile I guess thats something clams have in common with people laugh As far as I know , clams do not express emotions , and do not have a higher faculty ? I think people differ from animals in many ways although there are some similiarities and common traits. The most important way I can think of that humans are different than animals is that we are much smarter ( everything else , including technology , comes from this ) . And thats a difference of degree only ; dolphins are much smarter than fish , but they are both still animals. Do Clams go to Heaven ? Do humans ? For that matter , do humans deserve to go to heaven ? That would be a matter of Faith Cheers Rhianna Zodiac , groovy fortunetelling , mystical fun stuff
