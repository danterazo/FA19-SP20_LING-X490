Another aspect I find disturbing is the way this entire chapter reads , digital and analog have their own pitfalls , and one really doesnt sound better than the other. If this were the case , then why are manufacturers constantly trying to make digital sound more analog ? Are they really , or does their ad copy say that because it is number 3 on the list of favorite consumer buzzwords ( right after tube and warm ) ? A great analog deck sounds better than a great digital system. I would say thats a matter of opinion , but thats not the point I wanted to make. In the -middle- of the market , and definately as you move further down the audio food chain , digital usually sounds _better_ than the analog alternatives. Those working with top-of-the-line gear , analog or digital , represent a very small minority of the pro audio demographic. I make my living as a full-time audio practitioner , and even I rarely get to use top drawer systems. The point is that even if one were to declare analog to be ultimately superior in a best-case scenario , it doesnt mean it will be at all points below that. In your world , the analog tools at your disposal sound better than the digital ones. In my world , the opposite is true. Lorin
