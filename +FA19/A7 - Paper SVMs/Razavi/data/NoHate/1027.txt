. . What if that tomato produces a chemical your body has never seen , and . doesnt know how to handle ? . .What happens when you eat something you havent tried before ? It contains .many chemicals which your body will not have encountered before. What .happens then ? Or when you take a drug you havent had before ? What .happens ? I am talking about chemicals that NO ONE has ever eaten. My body has an evolutionary history & can handle anything that humans & most of their ancestors ate in the past , but not some chemicals that never existed before. I am working on creating wildlife habitat that is off-limits to humans ( " pure habitat " ) . Want to help ? ( I spent the previous 8 years fighting auto dependence and road construction. )
