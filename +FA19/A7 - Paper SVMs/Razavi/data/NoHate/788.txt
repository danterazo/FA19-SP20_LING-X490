Have you installed any other visual studio product along with VB 6 ? Two months ago I installed VB 6.0. I have win 98 ( not 2nd edition ) with IE 5.0. From the first time when I was surfing from one site to other i had two dialog boxes : First " A run time error has occured. Do you wish to debug ? Line984 Error XMLParser is undefined " and the second " A run time error has occured.Do you wish to debug ? Line 230 Error 230 XMLParser is undefined " . First I installed SP 2 for VB6.0 i visited the Microsofts site which telling that we had to install SP3. I installed it but nothing done.I unistalled VB but messages errors arent stopping.Is there anyway before formatting the Hard Disk ? Thanks Spiros Posted via CNET Help.com
