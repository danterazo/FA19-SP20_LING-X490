a great C + + book : Object-Oriented Programming in C + + , Second Edition by Robert Lafore published by the Waite Group [ ISBN 1-878739-73-5 ] . I use it religiously. I just thought I would point out that this book has reached the Third Edition , which reflects the changes in the C + + standard since the 2nd edition was published. Looks like a good book , it covers a some Object Orientated Design if I remember correctly , which is a good thing. From Amazon : ISBN : 157169160X Alot of C + + books are in the Third Edition now , so check youve found the latest before buying any. Jason .
