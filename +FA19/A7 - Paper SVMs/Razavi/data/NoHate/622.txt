I have a new LS-2000 scanner which I have bought for couple of weeks. Yesterday I scanned my negative with the " ICE " turned off , I found all photos get one or two straight lines along the direction of film feeding besides the white dots of dust. I checked the film under strong light and believed the film surface has been scarched after passing through the SA-20 strip film feeder. I opened the SA-20 and found the scarch lines matched 2 of the plastic guiding webs at the rear inner compartment. I want to ask : 1 ) Anyone get the same problem ? 2 ) Is it caused by curved film strip ? 3 ) Shall I take the machine to service ? 4 ) How to avoid ? Thanks all !
