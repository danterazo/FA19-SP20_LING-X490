Unfortatenly , Brian and many others are jumping to an incorrect conclusion. Gartner Group came up with it is research independently of MS. The URLs you refer to are the free pages that MS puts together quoting heavily from the Gartner Report. That actualy report from Gartner is available , for a fee , from them on their website. I think youll find , as I have , that it would be a waste of money. All the good parts are published there by MS for free. MS pays Gartner for the right to publish excerts. Obviously , MS can do whatever facts Gartner documents is pure BS. You need only do a little more research to determine this. I thought you were into these sorts of things Brian ? You mean youve never seen this sort of activity with reports from Gartner ? Hmmm. On 10/15/99 , AM , " Brent Davies " Re : Gartner Group nails coffin on linux : | Read the fine print at the bottom of the Gartner article : " Written by | Microsoft " Are we looking at the same fine print ? What I read is , " Copyright IDG Communications 1999. " Microsoft Web Letter is published by Microsoft. Additional editorial material supplied by Gartner Group , Inc. © 1999. Editorial supplied by Microsoft is independent of GartnerGroup analysis and in no way should this information be construed as a GartnerGroup endorsement of Microsofts products and services. . Yada , Yada , Yada. For a sample , see : If you meant , " Read between the lines " then thats what you should have said. I might actually agree with that comment. The Gartner Group is akin to that metalic clothes designer who predicted that MIR would crash into France during September of this year. IOW , they are not often right. -B
