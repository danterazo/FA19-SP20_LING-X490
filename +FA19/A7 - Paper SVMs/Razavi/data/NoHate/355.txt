Paul F. Austin said : Actually , according to Keegan , Schleiffen couldnt work through the flaws in the marching plan that was key to getting all the German armies where they needed to be before the French could mobilize and get _their_ troops to the frontiers. In true Micawberish fashion Moltkes staff assumed " something would turn up " . It didnt and the French did. I have heard this theory too . there is an article in one of the Commands ( I think 13 or 16 ) called " The Marching Man " which discusses how armies were until WWII completely limited to the speed of a marching man and that the GREAT flaw in the Schleiffen Plan was that it assumed that peak march rates could be maintained for a month at a time , and resistance overrun without much slowing the armies down. Now , such an outcome was POSSIBLE. Armies have panicked in defeat before , and if the French totally collapsed and the Germans went all-out , the Schleiffen Plan could have been achieved , in my opinion. BUT . A plan which demands prolonged peak performance on the part of ones own army , and incredibly incompetent and demoralized behavior on the part of the enemy army , coupled with NO unpleasant surprises ( like Belgian resistance or a BEF ) is simply not realistic. Which of course is essentially your point , too.
