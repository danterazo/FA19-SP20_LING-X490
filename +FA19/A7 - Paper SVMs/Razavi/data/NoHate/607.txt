I live in Costa Mesa and was wide awake. More interesting than the quake itself were the flashes , like heat lightening , that lit the entire sky. These were yellow/orange , not blue. There were at least 3 during the quake and there were two more after I stopped feeling any movement , within about 2 minutes. Then there were no more , and I stayed up for about an hour. What were these ? Exchange ideas on practically anything ( tm ) .
