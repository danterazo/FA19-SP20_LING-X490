Every thing in the our universe has mass , right ? So , if my dreams exsist dont they have some weight ? What are you asking ? Seriously. If a dream you mean the image , then yes. I believe a theory ( not necessarily the theory ) is that REM somehow triggers images and that the mind puts them together. I dont think thats true , but I am nowhere near an expert. I think it is the brains way of " playing " . In any case , that dream is information. Think of it like a file on a computer. That file has weight in the sense that to store a file , you need to change the direction of te magnetic domains on a disk. But why does a region of domains that is more " organized " have more weight ( if , in fact , it does ) ? Wetboy snip
