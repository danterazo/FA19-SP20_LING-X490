( Below ) Do you know if , for example , the parent plant which contained the " terminator " gene produces pollen ? Regards , Jim Scanlon I would have thought the environmental lobby would want GM crops to possess a terminator gene since then it necessarily be incapable of reproduction and spreading ! In the west farmers predominately buy seed anyway. As a student I once worked in a grain mill in the seed grain division where we processed and bagged the new varieties of seed grain. The process was that a limited group of farmers contracted to grow the new varieties that had been developed ( 1st generation ) having contracted to observe very stringent conditions to preserve the integrity of the crop ( and get a very good price ! ) . Their product was then processed and bagged for sale to farmers for crop production ( 2nd generation ) as the yields and disease resistance of these varieties was superior to previous varieties there was a ready market. The new varieties were produced by the national plant breeding station in the UK. At that time they were produced by conventional technology. The use of a limited number of genetic lines is a concern no matter how the seed is produced and producers and countries do maintain seedbanks for this reason , also even the evil plant breeders need a parent stock to produce their next generations from so it is certainly not in their interest to eliminate all other varieties , quite the contrary ! Farmers in the third world certainly have concerns about stability of supply but of course would still be free to plant a small corner of their field as a strategic seed reserve of conventional varieties and still benefit from the improved yield of the new varieties. I would assume that 10 % would be ample ? I sometimes wonder if some of the critics here and elsewhere have ever worked on a farm or in an agricultural community ? Phil .
