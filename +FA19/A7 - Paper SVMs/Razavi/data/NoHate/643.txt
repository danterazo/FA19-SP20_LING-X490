I dont really think you guys get it. this is for a BUSINESS. most likely 10 packs per week tho The commercially manufactured packs that I send away for are made with a spotwelder that is no bigger than a toaster. As I am spending tremendous ammondts of $ $ $ on freight and I could make about 40 % more if i did them myself. I can not solder these together as I am selling them to the general public. If you could understand this maybe you can help me out better. Dunno what you are getting uppity about , you asked for free advice and got it , some good , some bad , some humerous. Thats the way of newsgroups. Live with it ! Anyway , I have done a bit of spot welding with thermocouples , and use a 7500 uF cap charged to 40-80 volts depending on the wire gauge. Works pretty well , but you need a low impedance cap , I had to hunt around for a long time to find a good one. Nowadays I would try a bank of photoflash caps , as they are designed for this sort of pulse discharge. I have a box of Rubycon 350 volt 370uF ones I am going to try one day soon. I will start with about 20 in parallel. I found them at a surplus market for about 30c each. They are a little larger than an AA battery. You could also try your local photo-finisher for the one-shot cameras with flashes , maybe you can get enough for free. Barry Lennox
