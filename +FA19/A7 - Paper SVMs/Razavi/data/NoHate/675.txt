I am trying to record something from a tape deck of a stereo to my computer. I connected the rca jacks to the Radio shack adapter and connected it to the line IN of sound card. If I play the tape deck the sound comes thru my computer speakers. When I hit record on the Windows Sound recorder the green line stays thin and does not move although the gray bar does move to the right. All windows sounds ( startup etc ) play fine. I checked recording and playback volume in control panel and raised them to max volume with no improvement. I also un installed and re-installed sound recorder as well as drivers for sound card I have a AMD K6 200Mhz w 128mb Ram and a S # Sonic Vibes PCI sound card. I also have same problem if I use mic with mic input. Do I have a bad sound card ? Is there anything I can do to fix this ? Thanx
