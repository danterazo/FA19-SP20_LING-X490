G Snow Weekes D Joseph Namenstinkov Baron Strudwick Komerniski Baron Hawgood F Messier Cassels Bertuzzi Chubarov Kariya Brashear May York Naslund Mogilny Muckalt Schaefer Scatchard Klatt IR Ohlund Allen Hendrickson With Jovo signed and Legace picked up on waivers , two people need to be moved off the active roster. Who stubs a toe to get put on IR or is sent to Syracuse. My guess is Snow goes to IR and I hope Klatt gets sent to Syracuse. Is there a chance that Joseph could get through waivers ( I believe he needs to be waived to go down ) ? The Rangers claimed that they would reclaim Namenstinkov if the Canucks tried to send him down. BananaJr _ Department of Statistics Ohio State University
