I am going to start a design of a low cost Z80 based computer as hobby. Planned features : snip I hate to be a party-pooper , but I suspect the cheapest way to do this is to buy a bargain-basement Pentium PC and write or find a Z80 simulator for it. You get most of the peripherals built-in , and when you get bored with the project you can turn it into something at least vaguely useful : I have a very soft spot for the Z80 , as it was the machine I cut my microprocessor teeth on ; but the world has moved on since CP/M. But maybe just maybe. it could be a fun thing to do. Come to think of it , maybe I should dust-off the old Z80 CP/M box in the attic this weekend ; Jonathan Bromley I gave away my CPM computers years ago. Except for the exercise , why design another ? Don Before you buy. Maybe to regain control of what the computer does and when. Instead of beliving that Microsoft has the knowlegde to control the PC at any time without a blue-screen : . Hardware and software vendors today are very " we love MS " likely. And that controls prices and envirroment. And by the way INTEL has ones admited that Z80 compared to Pentium and Pentium Pro , was faster in block moves ( if you look away from the clock signal differences ) . In other words , the little 8bit devil is faster than the Pentium and Pentium Pro to read and rewrite blocks , if run with the same clock frequency. I still have my DOS PC , to develope hardware-close software on. Due to the major mistake of Windows witch crashes on some events. And multi- tasking is possible in DOS and CP/M : KLARO Expect the worst , only then will you be favourably surpriced Before you buy .
