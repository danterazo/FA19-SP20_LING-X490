_ Can I capture sound from my speakers . . . without using the microphone ? I have an executable ( .exe ) file that plays a tune that I want to save as a .wav file. I have a microphone , but I am trying to figure out if there is any way to configure the Line-In Line-Out capabilities of my Soundblaster card to take whatever is playing through my speakers , store it , and allow me to save it as a .wav file with any sound editor. I want to avoid the microphone thing because obviously if I could avoid the noise and somehow get the feed directly from this application into a .wav editor , thats my preference. Thanks for the help ! Shy1 _
