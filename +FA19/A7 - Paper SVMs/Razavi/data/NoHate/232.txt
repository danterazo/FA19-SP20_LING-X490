Thanks for the information. Your sniffing faq answered a lot of fundamental questions I had. To follow up : It appears that you are indeed receiving the initial SYN packet , but that your machine isnt responding with a SYN ACK. This indicates some firewalling going on at the machine itself. However , when I telnet to port 25 from behind the firewall my machine does respond. It is only when I telnet to port 25 from outside the firewall that it doest respond. Is there a reason why my machine would respond to a request from inside the firewall , but not to a request from outside the firewall ? And only do so for port 25 ( port 23 and 110 work fine ) ? thanks. p.s. I am running RedHat Linux 6.0 Anyway , you might want to see my sniffing-faq : Robert Graham Exchange ideas on practically anything ( tm ) .
