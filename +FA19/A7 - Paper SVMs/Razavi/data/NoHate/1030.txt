( Thanks for un-crossposting , thats a good thing. ) Do you honestly think that computers do arithmetic ? I have yet to find a spell checker that knows what I am talking about when I write. And what about the spell checker that likes to sprinkle nots all over the place. Computers do not do it better ; they may do it faster. Yes , I do think computers do arithmetic. there is a learning curve to using them , but they dont make sign errors , . Sure they do. . they dont misplace digits in long division , . Consider divide checks , underflows and overflows. . and as you say , they are extremely fast. No , they are just faster. : ) ) As for spell checkers , if youve got one that sprinkles nots all over the place , then youve got a bad one. And how do you verify that a spell checker will never insert a not ? I occasionally find it helpful to have the computer tell me things like how many ms and ts are in " committee " thats a time and effort saver. it is certainly possible to use calculators stupidly in education , but it is not obvious to me that teaching the use of slide rules or concentrating on the joys of manual arithemtic is a useful remedy for that. Consider the power company pulling the plug ( for whatever reason ) . Do you really want to stop working just because you dont have electricity to run your computer. Do you really want to have to go to the store to buy a replacement battery before finishing the calculations youve been doing ? Always , always have a fallback procedure. I generally have Plans A-Z , then I have backups to those. : Just an irritation.I would like the people who make change whenever I buy something to be able to give me the correct change. I am finding that I am teaching how to count change more and more these days. /BAH Subtract a hundred and four for e-mail .
