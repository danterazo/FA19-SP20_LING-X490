Hello , it is not part of the standard as of f95. Youll have to RTFM , looking for something like getarg ( ) , iargc ( ) , etc. In the f2k standard , there is a way , but dont expect f2k compilers for a few years. This may be a trivial question. How a Fortran program reads its command line arguments ? Suppose , a.out is a Fortran executable code and the command is % a.out x y z where x , y , and z are command line arguments. In C , there are an integer variable " argc " stores no. of string tokens in the command line and " argv " stores the string tokens. I can easily do this by using these two variables in C. But , how can I do this in Fortran ? Thanks. Wei-keng Cheers ! Purple Sage Computing Solutions , Inc .
