Also check that " temp " and " tmp " are pointing to a subdirectory , not the root of a drive. i.e. temp = x : \ temp \ , NOT temp = x : \ . Try " temp = x : \ temp " , I think you will have a problem with the trailing slash. Be sure to look for duplicate entries for these. I think it was Lotus SmartSuite , that installed a second set of each , and the TCPIP install , and VAC + + , will create one for TMP. Other programs may do likewise. Only the last entry will be used. hope this helps. From the PC of Doug Bissett
