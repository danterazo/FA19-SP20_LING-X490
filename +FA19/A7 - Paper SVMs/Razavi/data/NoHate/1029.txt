+ On 25-Sep-99 them. Other than R that , its just a desk ornament. I unfortunatley have to use a PC for R everything else , cause the software and support exists. Uhhhexactly what is it that you can do on your PC that you can not do on your Amiga ? For me , WYSIWYG web development. WYSIWYG does NOT exist when you are talking about HTML HTML are a Markup-language. I think you know what I meant here . There is no Amiga program you can drag and drop to that has nested layers , etc like Dream Weaver2. I also use Hot Metal Pro and Homesite 4.01 Now add Fireworks2 and Uleads PhotImpact 5.0 , GifSaver , and other ULead products , plus finally Paint Shop Pro. Hard to get close to this combo on an Amiga. I wish I could , but they just arent there.
