Freebanders and the so called 10 meter squatters , are like apples and oranges. Two different things. I tried like all get out to hear Illegal operations on 10 meters all I heard was Spanish stations not using call signs. The conversations on news.rec.radio.misc also dont like you , you must be a real jewel , he he he ! Since the sun spot cycle is going to allow great DX over the next few years , what is the FCC gon na do about all the latino RF coming in on 10 meters ? You know that all those countrys in central and south America use 10 meter radios for their taxis , etc .
