I am not sure how to check a variable that was assigned a value from cin for an integer. From what is said later , I assume that this " value " is actually just a character string. I see two ways , one is using isdigit ( varname ) What does this do ? Maybe check for a sign or decimal point character ? but i cant seem to get my borland c + + compiler to work. What does this mean ? Is your computer plugged in ? : ) The other way is using a case statement ( switch ) where i give it all the possible choice , What choice ( s ) ? but there must be a better way no ? ? Perhaps. But first perhaps you should give a clear statement of what you want to accomplish. If it is to read a numeric value and decide if it has a fractional ( decimal ) part then say this .
