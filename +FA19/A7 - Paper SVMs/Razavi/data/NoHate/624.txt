I have a kewl new search-form for Deja that I am putting together : Would some of you guys and gurls like to try it out , and let me know if you find any bugs ? Also , let me know if you have any suggestions for extra features I could add ? Make your " keywords " submission box fill a full screen. No. Delete one date box , leaving only " from " . No. Make alt.food.peeps your example group. No. HTH ! HAND ! Simon Clark - Urban Crime-Fighter PS You can now save your searches. Yay ! Just dont make them too big , or try to save too many of them bad things might happen ! Before you buy .
