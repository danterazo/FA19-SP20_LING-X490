Now I KNOW you guys are wrong , with all the MAGNIFYING goin on ! Wrong about what ? You wouldnt be arbitrarily minimalizing now - or would you ? Pontificating ; ( tho in a singy-songy leprechanish type ( d ) manner ) . " the only reason I accept that you do indeed have any biz responding to this snippet of this thread is indeed , an irristable urge , to take a mystical and magical and daring quantum-leap , singing out loud and out-of-tune , with your own hitherto proferred minimalistic reviews , upon the aesthetics of music appreciation " . tsk tsk fg Linda f = facetious i.e. face the music type connotation i.e. somewhat impish , elfish , lucky charmish ( i.e. a rare 4 , instead of a 3 leaf clover ) etc etc etc. heh heh ( grin ) Jerry
