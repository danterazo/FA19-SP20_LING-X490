Where to we registered PMMail v2.0 users stand in relation to PMMail v2.1 ? Is it a free upgrade ? Cheap upgrade ? Total new product ? Do I just installed the new version over my existing PMMail v2.0 installation ? I threw caution to the winds today and simply installed 2.1 into my PMMail directory.all went wellI lost no data , and my registration info was untouched. So I would call this a free upgrade. Exactly what it upgrades I am not sure about.there didnt seem to anything in the readme file to indicate new or improved features [ but then I was just home after working a nightshift , so my consciousness was slightly altered. ] . And , in case there is not enough question marks in the above text , why has SouthSofts Web site not been updated to reflect these new goings-on ? Well , obviously SouthSoft has sold PMMail to BluePrint Software Works , so looking at the SouthSoft pages wont tell you too much. I dunno if this is a good thing or a bad thing , but I guess time will tell. While I will be forever grateful to Bob Novitsky for creating PMMail ( I happened on an early beta just as my frustration with UltiMail Lite was reaching a climax ) I must say that I dont much admire SouthSofts behavior over the last few months. Bob and Icon used to frequent the newsgroups , and keep their webpages up-to-date , but lately we have been starved for news and [ according to some ] support. Given that email is the # 1 application for the Net , people care _a lot_ about their email apps , and I think it behooves the creator of a popular email app to keep his/their customers in the loop. Anyhow , it looks like we now have BluePrint to deal with.I hope they will be more open than SouthSoft has been David T.
