Try talking to your neighbor about the interference problem your having. Kindness goes a long way. I know this is a violation of FCC regulations regarding interference , but what can we do about it ? Who do we report it to ? I would appreciate any info you can provide. I really dont want to interfere with this guys hobby , but it is really not fair that his hobby interferes with ours .
