It seems that quite a bit of the " who would win in this situation " type of post in this newsgroup come down to a disscussion of BJJ/judo vs. other arts. A lot of the posts seems to favor BJJ in a fight , citing that most fights end up on the ground. I very recently starting studying Shorin-Ryu Karate , and from what I understand it emphasizes striking and kicking , with not as much emphasis on throwing and grappling. My question is this : where does this leave me in a conflict with a grappler ? More specifically , where would this leave someone practicing Shorin-Ryu when fighting a non-martial arts high-school/college wrestler ? Again , I just recently started in the martial arts , and I just as recently started reading this newsgroup , so if this topic has already been covered to the point of exhaustion I didnt know it. Sorry to drag it up again. And thanks in advance for any replies. Scott
