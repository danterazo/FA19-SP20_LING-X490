Because we got a friendly robot car to Mars for $ 250 million. There are movies that cost more than that to make. Well , thats a point. How much money gets spent by Hollywood each year to produce thousands of miles of celluloid that mostly has no redeeming value whatsoever ? At least you can learn something from moon rocks. good point . took the kids to air & space and we all got to touch moon rocks. so they learned that went to the moon and brought stuff back ( for 5 and 9 that seems fine ) . they were puzzled that we could not presently go to the moon. that was a tough one to explain , especially when we were there 30 years ago. but it is irrelvant what hollywood spends in movies that have no redeeming value at all. that is private money being invested , not tax $ . one can note that there are many people who feel that bringing back a moon rock was not worth the billions of tax $ spent and that we got nothing lasting from it. thats a hard argument to fight. rk hopes the " spin-off " argument thread doesnt get started again good night , rk
