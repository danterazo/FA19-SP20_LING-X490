Hello , IF you have the room on your hard drive you could copy the CD onto it , then boot from floppy to go. The only problem : you would most likely want the disk space back , and Windows will try to refer to that drive every time you install hardware ( or software requiring support ) . I know it is possible to edit the registry to get rid of the annoyance , but I am too chicken to try ( and cant remember exactly how ) . I have done it for a number of installs , and it is the fastest way to install as well. good luck ! Warren Hi all , I have a P120 laptop running 3.11 which I would like to upgrade to Win.98. It has an internal floppy drive but no CD-ROM , I dont have an external CD-ROM to plug in. I know it is possible to get 98 on floppy but I dont fancy feeding 50-odd disks ( or whatever ) . I do have a network card with which I can connect the laptop to our LAN and access a shared CD-ROM , but presumably the 98 upgrade process involves rebooting etc. which would loose the connection. Any way out other than 98 on floppy ? Help appreciated. Regards , Mark Graves Before you buy .
