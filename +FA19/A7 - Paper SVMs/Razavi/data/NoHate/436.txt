Maybe we have a different perception about the meaning of PUBLIC and PRIVATE in the first place. I suspect so. As I knew it , privacy is designed to prevent inadvertent human errors by segregating pieces from one another. A compiler doesnt have to respect this. Having a compiler really only be able to see public parts means that no information beyond the language level can be transmitted-what if the compiler , e.g. wanted to have a way to designate whether or not it figured out that certain functions were side-effect free ? Whether they could use some special calling convention ? Concepts which are not necessarily part of the Fortran language itself ? Personally , I think the notion that a compiler can or ought to only see one source file of the program at a time is the anachronism. Matthew B.
