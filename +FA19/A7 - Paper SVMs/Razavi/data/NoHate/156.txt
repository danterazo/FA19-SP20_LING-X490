To make a cheap isolation transformer , I have often seen the suggestion to take two identical power transformers , connect their secondaries together , and use ones primary as the input and the others as the output. Would this also work : use a dual-primary transformer ( designed for switchable 120/240V operation ) , leaving the real secondaries unconnected , and using one of the primaries as the output ? What sort of isolation or protection ability would I be giving up by doing things this way ? Transformer specs normally include a rating of the insulation between primaries and secondaries , but I have never seen one that specifies the amount of insulation between the primaries ( although there obviously has to be some guarantee of such , or they could produce a short across the AC line in their normal use ) . A related question : for a project of mine , I need to supply both 5VDC , and roughly 170VDC , sharing a common ground. Would it be safe to use a dual-primary transformer , connecting only one of the primaries to the AC line , and using the other as the secondary for the high voltage output ? Jason Harper
