Hmmm. I just got my SBLIVE today , but here is a guess. On my SBLIVE ( x-gamer version ) there was an internal digital audio linkup to the DVD drive. Havent got my DIN cable yet for the FPS 2000 speakers , but will arrive soon. Also , try turning up INPUT under sound options , if thats the prob. Mike Evans ( Avenger ) I recently got a set of Cambridge Works FPS2000 4-point surround speakers that has a digital input compatible with my SBLives digital DIN output. The speakers got good reviews and the fact that it was made to work specifically with the SBLive seemed to make it a natural choice. However , while I get great sound , I get no audio whatsoever from my Creative Dxr2 DVD. The DVD drive has an analog connection to the Dxr2 board , and then there is an analog connection from the Dxr2 board to the SBLive. I thought perhaps I had disturbed a connection while connecting the digital DIN output , but this is not the case. As soon as I unplug the digital cable and use an analog connection from the SBLive and the FPS2000 speakers , the CD/DVD audio works just fine. Any ideas what might be causing this ?
