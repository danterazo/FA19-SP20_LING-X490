Way back in grad school , when I first learned of Hamiltons theorem , I almost immediately thought " Ah Ha ! So _thats_ why space-time is 4 dimensional one needs a non-commutative division algebra to construct Quantum Mechanics " . But I have been unable to carry this any further This sounds like the Anthropic Principle. If space were other than 3 ( non temporal ) dimensions we could not have formulated QM. But we did formulate QM etc. etc. etc. Why dont I find this convincing , even though it is logical. Bob Kolker
