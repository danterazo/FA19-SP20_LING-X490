So figured I should share it with you. there is a shareware ( $ 125 to register ) perl script to take the raw logfiles from Raptor and generate a couple of html reports. I found it at NT resource kit seemed to work just fine with this script. Anyone know what the easiest way to monitor traffic through a Raptor v6 by dest. domain and source host name ? Thanks in advance for any help you can muster Carl
