I am not in a very good position to give you any advice , but here goes anyway. Something to consider is that C + + is a superset of C. Everything you can do in C is also available in C + + , but C + + introduces objects and other nuances. My recommendation ( if you are only considering C and C + + ) is to start with C + + . There are some things you may have to unlearn if you learn C first. Not much of a recommendation , I am afraid. As with most things in the computer world , it is a matter of preference. I can , however , advise you of a great C + + book : Object-Oriented Programming in C + + , Second Edition by Robert Lafore published by the Waite Group [ ISBN 1-878739-73-5 ] . I use it religiously. Good luck ! Kenn Guilstorf Can anyone tell me if I should learn C or C + + first ? I have to teach myself and I cant get any college courses .
