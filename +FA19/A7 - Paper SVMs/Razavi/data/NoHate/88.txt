Whatever you want to call it , it isnt nice to do things for your own benefit that will wind up screwing the entire profession in your own country. Someone who does this lines their own pockets. You dont see American auto worker rooting for anyone who tries to help the Japanese import cheaper cars , I dont think. Well , we have yet to objectively establish that it is screwing the entire profession. Thats why I dont see it as black/white , right/wrong. Maybe I would have a better understanding if you explain to me why you believe it is .
