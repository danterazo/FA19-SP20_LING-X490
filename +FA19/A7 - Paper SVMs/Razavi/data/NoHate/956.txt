Any comments on sharpness , contrast , flare , build compared w/ other 24 Nikkors or Nikkor zooms ? Better than similar 28 ? Thanks Hi : I skipped the 28mm/f2.8 since I had the 28-70mm/f3.5 -4.5 at the time. I like mine. Very sharp , contrasty. I havent had much flare problem with the HN-1 hood. Build is excellent. The focus ring has the right amount of drag. The lens is light and very well built. I keep it despite most of my other lenses have 62mm filter size. Not quite as extreme angle as the 20mm/f2.8 A good , sharp general purpose wide angle. You wont be disappointed. Jim
