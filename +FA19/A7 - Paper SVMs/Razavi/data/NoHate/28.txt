Yes , and even g77 " only " uses the f2c converter. That is simply not true. Where did you get this " data " . Not ? I dont really use g77 but I thought ( I read in the SuSE docs ) it would merely run the f2c and hand the result over to the local cc. If this is not the case ( or it was and has been changed ) then sackcloth and ashes shall be my garment. That sounds like a description of the fort77 perl script that comes with some of the linux distributions. I dont happen to have SuSe , so I dont know whether it is included there , but it wouldnt be surprising. Yes such a thing exists. And it does a good enough job of looking like a " regular " Fortran compiler that I have seen a fair number of people who used it and yet werent aware that was what it was doing. But its not g77. Different animal. You might even have both the fort77 script and g77 available in the same distribution as choices. Richard Maine
