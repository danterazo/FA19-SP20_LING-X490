Generally I agreebut I am not sold on Weekes. He went down every time the puck was nearby. Richard Brodeur had some success with that style , but then he had an awesome glove hand to compensate. The good thing is that they have Andy Moog as the goaltending coach. I dont know what you think , but this guy will certainly be able to point out Weekes weaknesses and correct them before everybody can take advantage of them and make him look like a big old swiss cheese.
