On Fri , 1 Oct 1999 + 0900 , " Michael Caldwell " Concensus where I am from tends to be that Rural is farmland and the smaller towns that support farms. Okay , so the boys and girls in Watsonville are rural because the town is primarily agricultural ? BZZZ. At 30,000 it is nowhere near being a smaller town which supports farms. The sort of town I am thinking of has a Pub , garage , golf course and dairy ( in that exact order if some are missing incidently , you dont have a town with dairy without golf course , and you dont have a town with golf course without pub and garage ) , and nothing else except a crossroads or two with small cottages lining each side. we are looking at 500-600 " town dwellers " at most. In Midwestern America , a very small rural town has ( always ) a grain elevator and some kind of general store ( often attached to or affiliated with a gas station , though not always ) , and usually a bar or two. I am guessing they likely have a school , but I have not generally spotted it if so. I cant say that " dairy " or " golf course " are even on the horizon for most of them smile. Used car and/or farm equipment dealership would probably come first. In the Eastern US , town name signs usually have the date they were founded or settled. In the Midwest , it is population , and in the West , it is elevation above sea level. As a broad and no doubt exception-ridden generality.
