Begin quote I just happened to notice this and put it together with a few other items about ICR people : Have you noticed that technically trained creationists are almost always engineers rather than scientists ? I know that engineers have to master maths and some physics ( enough to design a car or build a bridge that doesnt fall down ) , but apparently they are not always taught to think critically. snip End Quote That plus a cow will give you calves. You need to be careful how you define " engineer " and how you define " scientist " . If by scientist , you mean someone with academic credentials , i.e. a Ph.D , and if by engineer you mean someone with at least a bachelors degree , you are comparing apples and oranges. Your scientists have made it through a much more difficult educational gamut. The right comparison would be engineers with Ph.Ds. But , thats a moot point since I have not made the observation you have about engineers spouting off about creationism more often. Maybe I know more engineers and have a better sample. Dunno. it is also bogus that engineers are not taught to think critically and also bogus that scientists are. I think the only characterization I would accept is that as a group scientists are more stubborn than engineers. And that is , in some sense , a job requirement for each group. GaryFostel-
