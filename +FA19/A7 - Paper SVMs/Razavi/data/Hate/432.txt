Cant believe this Georgie-porgie.are you STOOPID ? Julian Jaynes ideas was anti-Cartesian you dipshit. He ascribed the rise of religion to different functions of L and R hemispheresvoices in the head to be precise. Penrose ascribed consciousness to possible quantum actions in the brain ( ie no non-computational algorithm ) NOT " god " . Your theory is unfasifiable. You have not answered my questions which quite frankly are first year Psych questions. You fail to even justify the thought process that led you to this theory. You quote references and sources which seem only to justify your theory and miss out the parts which are inconvenient.and the most unforgivable.you fail to describe/note any experiment/lab work to support your theory.you even miss the bleedin obvious.Cartesian dualism isnt even credible anymore as a Psych theory.you fail to mention other notables in this field such as Hebdige and Deutscheyou miss quote Penrose.shall I go on ? Or am I one of the 50 % that you just ignore because they dont agree with you ? Post some real science. Then we can have a heated debate. Ron
