Dennis Doubletalk , Why not put an end to all the skepticism ? How difficult would it be for you to re-post your prediction website , and proof of past prediction successes ? It wouldnt take nearly as long as it does to continually defend your position in your constant circular manner. I am quite sure we will not see any posts with substance from you , though. My request/challenge to you will , I am sure , be answered with more " Dennis-speak. " Hope not , but , we will see. Liz , One of many who believes you to be an attention-seeking , lonley , pathetic quack. PROVE YOURSELF , or quiet yourself , please. Liz
