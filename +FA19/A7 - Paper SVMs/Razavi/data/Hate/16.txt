you are lucky , my stupid comps clock keeps telling me it august the 12th every time i boot upguess i ought to change it , or keep reliving august the 12th. Groundhog Day ? I cant even remember if it was a good today to do over and overand out Several hundred grouse will probably tell you it was a very BAD day. ( At least , they would have )
