My speak for yourslef was presumably jocular. get a grip , Mihail Junebug thats for you to figure out ! Ilinden the Macedonian,not the Ftcogian buffoon ! You mean we only have two choices : a ) girl and b ) boy ? What about a third choice c ) hemaphrodite ? : ) Speak for yourself , Michael. The post offered apparently no choices , as there are few to no children writing here , but mena and women , although some conduct themselves as such , and no one should answer to aspersions upon their netnames , cf. ilindra vs. Ilinden Get a grip Galina. I was only being sarcastic. Thats why I put the smiley after the sentence to make sure that was clear. With most people , it is but with you , maybe not. But you know that already ilindra Are you a boy or girl ?
