you said my poems suck which is tantamount to the same thing. No it is not. I would expect someone with the language skills of a novelist and journalist to understand that. I suspect you are less knowledgeable in such areas than I originally thought. Surprise , surprise. Are you capable of anything other than sarcasm ? Have anything productive to say ? Are you capable of saying something postitive or is your role here completely negative. Do you thrive on the attention you get whatever it may be ? Do you find joy pouncing on strangers striving to communicate , relishing having the last word , in a flame war that matches wit for wit ? Do you have a life , or is this the only place you find it ? What are your credendtials ? Convince me that your opinion is worth my while. You certainly seemed to have found me worth targeting. Why ? Are you sincerely trying to help me , or just making yourself feel superior by tearing me down. The more time and effort you pour into crafting poems , the more it becomes a construct , an artifice , man-made , an affection. It may be well-planned , deep , with polysymbolic meaning lurking behind every symbol , but it is still just a terminal adulthood , who has nothing to say. Yes , I spin out random verses , poetry , with relative ease. I dont take it too seriously. it is meant to convey emotion , imagery , to get people to think in different ways. it is meant to be expressive. I enjoy writing it. I enjoy writing. Period. You have a choice. You can read me , or you could choose not to read me. Everytime you respond to me , you betray yourself. You prove your own hypocrisy. If youve read this far , I challenge you to just killfile me , let me have the last word. Have a great week ! CHEERS ! Now in MP3 ! check out PO BOX 685313 Austin TX 78768-5313
