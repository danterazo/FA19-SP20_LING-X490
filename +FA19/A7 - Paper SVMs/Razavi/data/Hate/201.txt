Ricardo Montalban is very gracious and engaging. 2. Crispin Glover is legally insane. 3. Van Johnson is a snotty creep. Until further evidence is reported , MattH More agreement with Matt. The heavens but be trembling. Montalban is one of the true gentleman of show business I can report personally. A sweet , kind man who deserves better roles. Johnson and Danny Kaye would get my votes as the snottiest , nastiest two of Hollywoods golden age. Kaye was especially disliked. I remember when he received his Jean Hersholt Humantarian award from the Academy that I looked around expecting to stand. Nobody rose. I have never seen that happen. Hell , half the auditorium rose for Kazan. Terry Ellsworth
