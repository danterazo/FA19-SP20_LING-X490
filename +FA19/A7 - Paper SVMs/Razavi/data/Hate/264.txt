Just re-watched " Platinum Blonde " ( 1931 ) . Top billing was Loretta Young ( b 6 Jan 1913 ) . Any recent news on her ? Although Loretta is by no means the oldest living movie star - off the : top of my head Hope , Hepburn , Ebsen , Albert , Sothern are all over 90 - I : wonder if any can match her 80 years since her film debut - 1919 in " The : Only Way " as a child on an operating table. Milton Berle was acting in films as a child , beginning in about 1915 or so. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. probably started about the same time as Loretta Young. Both are still alive AFAIK. PS : Is Bob Hope the oldest living major movie star ? What about " minor " ones ? OK,I will take my over-90s list and prune out all who dont act,etc. ( If any died lately,please advise ) " Gin and Kin " ,Japanese twins born August 1st 1892 ( they do TV commercials,does that count ? ) Dame Ninette de Valois ( June 1898 ) ( were her dance performances ever filmed ? ) Leni Riefenstahl ( Aug 22 1902 ) ( before she turned to directing,she acted ) Bob Hope ( May 29 1903 ) Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan ( Feb 28 1904 ) ( a producer ) Sir John Gielgud ( April 1904 ) Jan 1905 Charles Lane ( well known character actor ) Hildegarde ( Feb 1 1906 ) ( whats she famous for anyway ? ) Billy Wilder ( June 22 1906 ) ( director ) Gertrude Ederle Oct 23 1906 ( was someone saying she acted ? ) Fay Wray ( September 10 1907 ) Sir Run Run Shaw Oct 14 1907 ( Hong Kong filmmaker ) I thought he died. Frances Dee ( November 26 1907 ) Sir John Mills ( February 22 1908 ) John Mills died years ago , no ? Buddy Ebsen ( Apr. 2 1908 ) Eddie Albert ( Apr. 22 1908 ) Milton Berle ( July 12 1908 ) Penny Singleton Sept 15 1908 Arlene Francis ( October 20 1908 ) Imogene Coca ( November 18 1908 ) Victor Borge ( Jan 3 1909 ) Jean-Pierre Aumont ( Jan 5 1909 ) Luise Rainer ( born January 12,1909 ) [ or IS it 1910 ? ] Ann Sothern ( January 22 1909 ) Claire Trevor ( March 8 1909 ) Dolores Hope ( May 27 1909 ) ( was she a performer,or just a famous spouse ? )
