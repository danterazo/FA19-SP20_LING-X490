( hence your various medications ) What the fuck are you talking about ? And I didnt mean to infer that what you earn is a measure of character , but it is a measure of ability and mental capacity , or usage thereof. you are right , Artie. Everyone who makes a lot of money is really smart , and everyone who does not is really stupid. For proof , I can point to Trisha , Mia , and many other girls you have harassed via the internet , calling them " whores " becasue they dont want to go out with you , etc. I never called either one of them a whore. I will say , however , that in the past , I was an asshole to strangers for no reason. This is an aspect of my past that I regret , and I have done my best to make amends. The difference between you and I is that I no longer feel a need to get negative attention through this behavior. Why else do you think so many people want to kick the shit out of you ? As far as I know , you are the only one. We both know that will never happen. I mean , seriously- thats how you and I met. No , we met because Sean Fenly asked me if I would do an Indecision/Silent Majority show , which entailed contacting you. it is not like you come here to be informed about " hardcore. " True , but I dont come here to try to instigate internet battles , either. This little war here started because you saw my post , completely innocuous in nature , and decided to reply with the razor sharp witticism , " faggot " . It seems that no matter how much time passes , your hatred for me never dies down. I think thats pretty funny. Ha ha. - Bosse-de-nage
