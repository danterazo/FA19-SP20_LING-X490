A question just occurred to me How come all of these Hollow Earth advocates never go to this big huge hole in the ground themselves ? You know , snap a few shots , take a few samples , and then come back and stun the scientific world ? Is there a reason that they make their claims solely on the basis of satellite photos with missing data and third ( or more ) hand reports of long dead explorers ( which were probably fabricated in the first place ) ? = Phillips One of your " long-dead explorers " was Adm. Richard E. Byrd who came of a distinguished Virginia family and who ( so far as I know ) had nothing in his history that would indicate a predisposition to fabrications of any sort. This is absolutely hilarious coming from the liar Phillllips. There was a real controversy at the time of some of Byrds flights and the suggestion has been made more than once by reputable people that he might have falsified his flight logs. Go back to believing in forged quotes. YFE
