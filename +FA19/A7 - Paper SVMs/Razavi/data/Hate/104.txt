that since the determination of when the year 1 was in the common era was arbitrarily defined by a monk sometime in the 13th century there is little point in being scientific about when the millennium will turn. I think it was actually the 6th century or thereabouts. The 13th century might have been when the concept of BC was introduced into the calendar. You know , I was tripping on acid once , and night , and I had this amazing realization about how time must ; ve began. Like , some cave dude or dudess once realized that the sun keeps coming up and traveling across the sky , over and over , so they decided to count em : 1,2,3,4,5 , and then they ran out of fingers , so they quit. Then , maybe 10,000 years later , finally another cave person ( being more PC ) had the same idea , and they used both hands , and quit after 10 days. Another 10,000 years past , and another astute but still rather trogladilian cave dweller decided to use their feet too , 10,000 year , and yet another deciced to use their and their buddys feet ( and maybe a penis or some shit ) You get the idea though. Time has been being counted and recounted , over and over , for a zillion years ! ( One zillion is a 1 followed my oodles of 0s , in case you arent incrementally gifted ) .
