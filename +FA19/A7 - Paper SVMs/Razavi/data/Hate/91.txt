The United States Memorial Holocaust " Museum " Yup , thats right. Moran recommends to all deniers that they put the word " museum " in quote marks. We all have an idea of real museums. In fact we might as well put " United States " in quote marks since we all know what it is all about. Yeaj , for one thing , it is about Freedom of Speech and Religion , which really burns Morons ass. Sara = Phillips Oh , you really think the Holocaust Museum is about Freedom of Speech and Religion and not about Jewish power - yes ? There is a way we can put your theory to the test. Tell you what you do. Start a nationwide campaign to have erected in our nations capital ( and as close as possible to the present Holocaust Museum ) a similar museum to honor the victims of Stalin Ukrainian Holocaust of 1929-33. Try it and see how far you get. = Mr. Phillips needs to learn a little reading comprehension. I said the UNITED STATES stands for Freedom of Speech and Religion. Sara One is often amazed that Phillips doesnt choke to death as he is trying to dislodge both of his feet from his mouth.
