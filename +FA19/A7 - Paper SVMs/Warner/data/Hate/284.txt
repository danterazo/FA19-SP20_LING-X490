Charles Rivkin , who is billed as a French-speaking lifelong Francophile , evidently has decided to thank the country that has brought him such joy over so many years by doing what he can to destroy it. A graduate of Yale and Harvard and son of a Kennedy-administration ambassador , Rivkin may also serve as yet another example of how our most " elite " institutions are busily breeding an elite that is bent , for whatever reasons , on ruining the country that has offered them so much. Is it coincidental that New York had to endure the spectacle of a " Festival of the Cultures of Islam " in the very week that marks the 10th anniversary of the Muslim jihad-strikes against New York and Washington ?
