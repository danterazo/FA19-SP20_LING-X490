" Well , " the owner said , " the rat itself is just $ 75 , but you would want the book it comes with , it 's very important and costs $ 200 more. " " Well , " says the man - " I 'll take the rat-I really do n't need the book right now. " " Ok , it 's your choice , but you 'll be back " said the owner , handing the rat to the customer. The customer left and put the rat in the rear window of his small compact. As he drove down the FDR drive past Harlem he saw something amazing. Rats were starting to run after his car. First a few , than more and more , pouring out of buildings , sewers and abandoned lots , a multitude , millions of rats were running after his car , from all sides. Finally they began swarming over the car itself , intent on reaching the brass rat. The driver , fearing for his life pointed the car towards the East River and jumped out. To his amazement , the millions of rats followed the car right into the river and drowned ! The man headed straight back to the antique shop. " I knew you 'd be back , " said the owner - " I bet you want to buy the book , now , right ? " " Fcuk the book , " said the man - " you got any brass niggers ?
