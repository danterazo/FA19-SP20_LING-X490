" The activity of communal politicians in relation to the good of the state must correspond to the daily concerns of the industrial worker and to the worker in all professions. The way also stands open for the real judgment of achievements. In such communal elections we create the possibility of a preliminary election. Broad masses of the people can choose among personalities and need not rely upon lists. Candidates will be proposed by guilds , associations and by the German Order through its local representatives. As a result , the electors of parliament will rest upon a broad folkish foundation , not upon a nameless mass. The voting rights of women will also remain in communal elections. A folkish will , adapted to visible personalities and coming from below , will thus meet the ruling will from above. Absolute monarchy knew only the direction from above to below. Chaotic democracy only knew mass stagnation from below. The German city of the future , realized through the act of power of individuals , will not subject the type creating personalities to any election mood and moneyed deceit. It will maintain them under the state director in power , and it will renew them again and again through education , bringing them German order. Through the election process outlined , an unhindered method of advancement will be offered to creative personalities. The coming Reich is thus , as elaborated , Nationalist and Socialist. This means that it is not founded on mere votes , but on type welding passion and racially linked mankind. Nationalism in the most passionate form is the prerequisite and final goal of action. Socialism is state safeguarding of the individual under the mark of recognition of his individual honor and in favor of racial protection. "
