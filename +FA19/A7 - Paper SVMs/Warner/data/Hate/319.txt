[ IMG ] Islamic Protestors : Picture from the New English Review By Mister Fox. The British authorities are in league with Muslims against their own people. The constant appeasement of Muslims encourages them to do what they like. Birmingham police and Broad Street Marshalls allow Muslim taxi drivers to park in bus lanes , block double-yellow lines , make three-point turns and U turns in the middle of busy and over the central reservations on Broad Street with impunity. Members of the public constantly complain but the police ignore law abiding citizens and cover-up for Muslim law breakers. They do not just keep small things like that from the public : they suppress serious activities like the news of terrorist training camps near Birmingham. The editors of the Birmingham 's three local papers also kept it from the public. In Birmingham and London trainees learnt hand-to-hand combat and survival skills. For further training they were sent for military training in Yemen and Afghanistan. After the London bombings , The Times reported that " a dozen members " of British Muslim group Al-Muhajiroun " have taken part in suicide bombings or have become close to Al-Qaeda and its support network. " In January 2007 the group 's leader Omar Bakri revealed that Islamist extremists were infiltrating the police and other public sector organisations. The Daily Mail exposed eight members of al-Qaeda in the police .
