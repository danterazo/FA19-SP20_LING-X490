For any readers who may have an interest in what I was trying to get at with some of my comments above , I direct your attention to the Counter-Currents Publishing site , especially the recent articles by a F . Roger Devlin , and the supportive comments to them. There , I believe , you will find several examples of the ugly , Judiac-inspired views on women that infect so many American males ( and females ) that I was referring to . That many of the contributors and commentators at that site express support and admiration for Hitler and National Socialism makes me feel a little sick , to say the least .
