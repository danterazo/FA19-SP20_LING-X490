" Had he been prime minister , he said , he | | would have seized the chance then , while the world was watching China , | | to carry out the transfer of the Palestinians. " | | -- p. 137 Washington Report 09/1998 | | | | Barak : Blaming Netanyahu for opening the tunnel in 1996 which caused | | riots and the killing of about 70 people , mostly Palestinians. Barak | | said that Netanyahu did it the wrong way. Instead of opening the | | tunnel directly , he should have first announced some new housing for | | Palestinians , to distract the media , THEN open the tunnel. | | | | Rabin : " For all its faults , Labor has done more and remains capable of | | doing more in the future [ in expanding Jewish settlements ] than Likud | | with all of its doing. We have never talked about Jerusalem. We have | | just made a 'fait accompli. ' It was we who built the suburbs in [ the | | annexed part of ] Jerusalem. The Americans did n't say a word , because | | we built these suburbs cleverly. " | | -- Washington Report article by Paul Findley ( 11/1994 ) . Cleverly of | | course means without drawing American media attention. This difference | | in style ( never mind Palestinian rights ) makes Labor more favorable to | | U.S. leaders than the more embarrassing , in-your-face style of Likud. | + ------------------------------------------------------------------------ +
