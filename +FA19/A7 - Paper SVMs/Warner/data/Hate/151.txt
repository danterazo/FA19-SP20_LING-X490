Excellent and eloquant response , 100 % correct , but how to ,ake the masses understand ? i find it unbeleivable that time after time there is a recurrence of this abject stupidity by Muslims reacting to insignificant morons who simply want their 5 minutes of fame , and to get this simply goad the Muslim community with an act they know will inflame and enrage them. drawing a cartoon , burning a book...surely Islam is more stable than to fall by these 2 silly men ? or is that what the protesters and murderers are afraid of ? that Islam is a house of cards that could fall at the slightest breath ?
