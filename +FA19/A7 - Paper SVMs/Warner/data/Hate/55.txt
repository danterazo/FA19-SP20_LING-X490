Racial theories on improving the racial stock are used to justify immigration. In the second reading of the Commonwealth immigrants Bill ( 16/11/1961 , Lord Royle said , " would n't we be better off with a dash of darker blood ? " The multi-racialist Fenner Brockway ( later Lord ) wrote glowingly of mixed race people which is similar reverence as Nazis had for pure Aryans , " Fifty years ago I read a book by Sir Sidney Olivier , who had been Governor of Jamaica , recording what splendid human specimens , physically and mentally , were the progeny of mixed marriages on that island. Many of us who know the sons and daughters of mixed marriages will bear out this judgement. " ( 8 ) There is an organisation ion Germany that promotes mixed marriages. Eddie Izzard , the Lebanese born establishment clone , presented a television series celebrating the racial supremacy of mixed race people. This has the same structure as ideas of racial supremacy and has no superior morality but aims to destroy White people .
