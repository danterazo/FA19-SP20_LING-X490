The Chicago Jewish Sentinel published an article by Julia Steiner about the 'Commission on the Prevention of Intermarriage ' reporting that , " In the Torah , Jews are repeatedly warned that intermarriage endangers the survival of the Jewish people. " The news release goes on to say that , " Those who work with our youth must make an active effort to inhibit intermarriage both by speaking out against it and giving our youngsters positive reasons to remain Jewish. " And yet , on the other hand , Rabbi Abraham L. Feinberg has stated , " Until we learn to fight our ingrown fears of sexual relations between the races , the end of the race problem will not be in sight...Such a change will involve an inside-out remodeling of the white psyche... the deliberate encouragement of interracial marriages is the only way to hasten the process... we will never completely eliminate racial prejudice until we eliminate separate races.
