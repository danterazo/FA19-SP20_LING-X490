i am not a racist person at all. i am open minded and appreciative of other cultures however this trip made me realize that there really is a difference in the standard and quality of human beings geographically and ethnically and as much as I do not want this to happen , I can not be stopped from subconsciously discriminating against the cunning chinese who are more animals than human beings. I do believe it is better this way however , as it is better to avoid this group of people altogether than be affected by them .
