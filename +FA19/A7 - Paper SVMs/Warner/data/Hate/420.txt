Berry : I was voted in. Let 's get back to the history of The Klan. I want to finish on the history of The Klan... The Klan split up at the state level. The American Knights , The Knights of The Ku Klux Klan , and other smaller Klan groups. Now there are many Klan groups with four or five members each. They exist on the Internet. Some of the people claiming to be Grand Dragons are just 14 , 15 , and 16-year-old kids. They use these titles and assume these roles to get attention. The reason The Klan is in existence is for equal rights. We 're not against Blacks. We 're against niggers. My definition of a nigger , and I always say this , is no matter what color you are ... and takes away from society and does n't give anything back. We are not a Hitler group. We are not a White supremicist group. We are Christian , White separatists. I do n't have a problem with a Black living next door to me. If he goes about his business , goes to work , does n't mix with drug dealers , does n't beat on his kids or wife , and he 's a good neighbor then I have no problem with him. But if one comes in that I can put in the category of a nigger -- that does not work , has wild parties all the time , his kids are out stealing stuff , he 's out stealing and destroying the neighborhood -- then he is a nigger to me and I have a problem with him living next to me whether he 's Black or White .
