It seems to me , that ZOG has our troops dying for IT , not our country . What are we achieving in Afghanistan ? Are our soldiers going to start having to deal with missiles , just like the Soviets did ? We supplied the Afghans with missiles against the Soviets. Who is supplying them now , I do n't know , nor do I care. We need to get out of that pest hole. ZOG has us fighting Israel 's battles for it.Navy Seals
