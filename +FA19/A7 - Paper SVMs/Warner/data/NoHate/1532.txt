I arrived in Times Square around 9 : 30 on the morning of Sept. 11 , 2001. A large crowd was transfixed by the huge Jumbotron screens. Billows of smoke could be seen on the screens above us , pouring out of the two World Trade towers. Two planes , I was told by people in the crowd , had plowed into the towers. I walked quickly into the New York Times newsroom at 229 W. 43rd St. , grabbed a handful of reporter 's notebooks , slipped my NYPD press card , which would let me through police roadblocks , around my neck , and started down the West Side Highway to the World Trade Center. The highway was closed to traffic. I walked through knots of emergency workers , police and firemen. Fire trucks , emergency vehicles , ambulances , police cars and rescue trucks idled on the asphalt .
