Official America has a habit of not taking responsibility for its own actions. Instead , it habitually looks for a high moral pretext for inaction. I was in Durban at the World Congress Against Racism ( WCAR ) when the US walked out of it. The Durban conference was about major crimes of the past , about racism , and xenophobia , and related crimes. I returned from Durban to listen to Condoleeza Rice talk about the need to forget slavery because , she said , the pursuit of civilized life requires that we forget the past .
