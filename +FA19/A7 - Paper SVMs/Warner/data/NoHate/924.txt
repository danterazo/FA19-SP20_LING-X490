Hey , in China , if the same happened , people would start a row with the airport staff and demand full refunds. Immediately. There was a similar case last year , regarding passengers arguing with the staff for complete refunds ( they 've stayed on the plane for an extra 3 - 4 hours ; there was a problem with the taxiway ) - and when it proved unsuccessful , the angry irrational passengers rounded up the staff and physically attacked them .
