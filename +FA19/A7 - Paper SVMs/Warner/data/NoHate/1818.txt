I have to disagree with Fisher 's view of " freedom of speech " as a a nonsensical term. " without some limitations , speech would have no meaning ( ... ) Therefore , we restrict our speech in terms of sentence structure etc. " It 's all in the definition of speech , is n't it. Without sentence structure , etc. , an utterance is not speech , just words. Without meaning , it is just sounds. ( that 's the linguist in me talking ) . Also , to me , speech in itself is an action ; it can have beneficial or hurtful consequence as well as other actions .
