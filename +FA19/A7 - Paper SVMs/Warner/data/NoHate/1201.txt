How come you all are n't bitching about what is going on in Korea or China ? What about terrorism in the Middle-East ? No , we all are butt hurt about racism because our surroundings and piers make a giant fucking deal about it. I suggest you guys and girls read " Harrison and Bergeron " , do n't worry its only like 3 pages long. Google that son of a bitch. If you can take the main themes from that and apply it realistically to our situation then you might get it. There is no such thing in the realm of possibility as 100 % equality and it will never exist. You have to find ways to CO-exist without using acts like this , because this wo n't fucking work. If you think it will then go fucking kill yourself after reading up on your history .
