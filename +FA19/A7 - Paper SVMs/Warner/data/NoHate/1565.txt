My have you ever lost touch with your roots. No one in Asia has any ` Asian pride ' whatsoever. People have Chinese , Korean , Japanese , etc . pride. You only become ` Asian ' in your ethnicity when you move to America. Try imagining what it 's like to have a father who tells you of course he 'd prefer you marry a Korean , he could live with it if you married a white girl from an English speaking country , but do n't even think of getting serious with that Filipina you fancy. That 's how ` pride ' works in Asia , at least NE Asia , buddy .
