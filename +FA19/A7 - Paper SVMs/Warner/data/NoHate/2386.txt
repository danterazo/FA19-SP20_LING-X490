We demand that the ideology of multiculturalism should immediately be removed from all government policies and school curricula , and that the state should adopt a policy of supporting the continuation of the cultural heritage and traditions of the indigenous populations . Multiculturalism has never been about tolerance. It is an anti-Western hate ideology championed as an instrument for unilaterally dismantling European culture. As such , it is an evil ideology bent on an entire culture 's eradication , and we , the peoples of Europe , have not just a right , but a duty to resist it and an obligation to pass on our heritage to future generations .
