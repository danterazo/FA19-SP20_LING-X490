Why would n't someone have a particular accent ? When people grow up in a certain area they inherit the linguistic traits of the people from that area. If someone is influenced by " Negro " culture , as you put it , they adopt their linguistic traits. Why are you typing in American English ? Are you trying to sound American ? What is " Negro " culture anyways ? It could mean Moroccan or Ugandan. It 's an outmoded word. You should have said " Hip-Hop " or another word I do n't like but that is acceptable : " urban " .
