My work involves just the sort of global system you take issue with. I work on a project for a multinational corporation that uses employee and contract staff from the US , Europe , and the global south. Apparently you feel work of this nature should be stopped , because it is intrinsically exploitative. I 'd only point out that as far as I know , no one is chained to their desks - everyone who participates feels that is in their personal interest to do so , considering their alternatives. If they did n't benefit , they would n't do it. And people come and go from the project all the time - it is n't a static , fixed permanent institution .
