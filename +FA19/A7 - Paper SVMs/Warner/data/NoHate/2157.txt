Bush has no plans to meet with the prime minister , although the two may " bump into each other " at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to be held in Bangkok , Thailand , the official said. The Associated Press quoted Rabbi Abraham Cooper , associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles , California , as saying , " Mahathir 's speech today is an absolute invitation for more hate crimes and terrorism against Jews . That 's serious.' ' Mahathir has often lashed out at Israel and the United States , which he blames for fueling violence and angst in the Arab and Muslim world. Malaysia , a moderate , mostly Muslim nation , has long been a critic of Israel 's occupation of Palestinian territories .
