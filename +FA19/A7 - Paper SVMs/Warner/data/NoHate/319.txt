Arnon Milchan is an Israeli film producer in Hollywood behind the famous " Regency " production brand. The Los Angeles Magazine ( April , 2000 ) writes : " Throughout the 1970s , '80s , and even up until the Gulf War in 1991 , Milchan was Israel 's foremost weapons procurer " . The Hollywood producer Milchan was also involved in the cooperation and military arrangements between Apartheid South Africa and Israel , to circumvent the boycotts. Milchan told CBS " 60 Minutes " ( 3/5/2000 edition ) : " I was playing an important role in the system of collecting money from South Africa , or transferring money , or helping South Africa in their financial transactions. " According to " 60 Minutes " , some of the money Milchan moved around the world came from an illegal $ 100 million slush fund set up by the South African government used to buy off politicians and foreign media outlets critical of its policies .
