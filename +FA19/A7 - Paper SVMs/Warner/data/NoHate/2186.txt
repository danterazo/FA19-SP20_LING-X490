The problem in our societies is n't primarily that individuals like Eriksen exists ( and believe me , every country has their share of these highly influential anti-nationalist intellectuals ) but rather that they are allowed unrestricted access to broadcasting networks , state channels , the main stream media in general to spread their hate-speech. They are allowed this access because 80 % of politicians and 98 % of journalists ( category A and B traitors ) are aiding and abetting them in the ongoing genocide. This while people like myself , who are trying to warn people of this extremist hate speech , are systematically ignored and demonised as , guess what ; racist , fascist extremists... It is nothing less than insane and it borders to an advanced level of psychopathic absurdity. A majority of Europeans are still susceptible to this brainwashing although this is gradually changing .
