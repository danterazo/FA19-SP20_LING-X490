I will show you something significant. If you turn to 1 Timothy 3 : 16 you will read these words concerning Jesus : " And without controversy great is the mystery of Godliness , Yahweh was manifest in the flesh , justified in the Spirit , seen of angels , preached unto the nations , believed on in the world , received up into glory. " If Yahweh was manifest in the flesh , He was justified in the Spirit , and He preached unto the Nations - when did He do that ? He did that before He commenced the three year ministry which was to be historic , that went up to His crucifixion. How I can prove to you that over here in the records , We have Christ as He returns from having been in a far country. As He arrives at the seat of Customs of the local government , they want to collect taxes from Him. Jesus turns to His disciples , saving , Of whom do the kings collect taxes , of their own or of strangers ? ( Here was , King Herod collecting taxes from Jesus ) Jesus , not to argue with them , said , Go down and catch a fish. They brought a fish to Him , and He said , Take the money out of its mouth. They found there the golden coin with which to pay the taxes .
