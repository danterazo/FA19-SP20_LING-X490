Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Thursday that he will travel to New York to address the UN General Assembly next Wednesday ahead of the Palestinian bid for statehood. Netanyahu said : " I have decided to personally convey the message of direct negotiation and striving for peace at the General Assembly - I know Israel does n't get a fair hearing at the General Assembly. It has an automatic majority which is quick to denounce Israel. I have decided to go...to tell the truth. " " The only way for a Palestinian state to come to be is through negotiations.
