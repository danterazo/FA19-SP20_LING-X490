Suppose I tell you that all during his youth , up to the time He was 30 years old , He was in Europe ? Jesus was here , and He was there ; He was preaching. You say , You can not prove that. Yes , I can prove it. I am going to show you something here that you will remember. In Luke we have the story of how Christ was baptized , and after Lucifer assaulted Him with temptation , He was away for awhile. After He returned to the City of Nazareth , He went down to the temple to preach. When He stood up with authority and power ( for He had the symbol of authority ; they had handed Him the scroll ) and He talked , the people said , Who is this ? Is this Joseph 's son ? Is this Joseph of Nazareth 's boy ; or who is this ? Now , my friends , if Jesus had been constantly in attendance here , if He had been growing up here since He was twelve years old , they would not have guessed or pondered who this was who stood up to preach .
