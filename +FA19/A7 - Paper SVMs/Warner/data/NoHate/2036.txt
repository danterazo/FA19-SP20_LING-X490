Hate speech is defined as " speech intended to degrade , intimidate , or incite violence or prejudicial action against someone based on his/her race , ethnicity , national origin , religion , sexual orientation , or disability. " [ i ] There has been much controversy regarding hate speech and laws that prohibit hate speech. This controversy arises first and foremost because of its conflict with the well-guarded right to freedom of expression , which secures each person the right to express ideas and opinions without governmental interference. In this paper , I will advance the view that the " right " to freedom of expression is not final and absolute. I will further argue that expressions of hate cause real harm to groups depicted in such negative ways , and that the rights of marginalized groups not to be spoken about or otherwise depicted in demeaning and derogatory ways outweigh any claim to freedom of expression. Finally , I will argue that marginalized groups are owed societal protection from hate speech .
