I 've been keepin ' track of stuff out there , and it does seem as though that Arab Spring thingamajig , whatchmacallit , dohickey ai n't such a lovely thing after all. It 's basically your garden variety kill fest , and somethin ' tells me this was the plan all along. Now , do n't get me wrong . It ai n't like I 've got some big connection upstairs or anything , but I 'll tell y'all this for sure. The media are having a field day with it. Think of it as the distraction that keeps on giving. Never mind the fact that God knows how much plutonium and cesium has been swept across the world from Fukushima. Never mind the fact that the banks have ripped off a bunch of folks and left them for dead - and got a slew of dough from Chicago Jesus. Never mind that the FBI has been turned into a protection agency for higher ups , so to speak , who kinda sorta needed the evidence taken out of that stupid solar panel company , aka , payola scheme .
