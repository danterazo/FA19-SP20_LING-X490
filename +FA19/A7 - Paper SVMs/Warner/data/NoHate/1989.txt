In the region , the power of Arab socialism and its related ideologies , as well as its major regional parties ( Ba'ath ) has faded after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. With Nasser and Saddam gone , only Syria remains ; with Libya somewhat affiliated. Hence , the increasingly important role in the region of Islamist parties ; which are now cooperating with the Arab socialists ( despite previously being enemies ) ; especially in Syria , where the leadership is adopting or being adopted by Iran through its support of Hezbollah. While Ba'athist Syria will likely stand for much longer , due to the competency of al-Assad and its proximity to Iran , Lebanon and Israel ; Libya - under Gaddafi - has been surrounded by Algeria and Egypt , respectively with compliant and very obedient , pro-US leaderships .
