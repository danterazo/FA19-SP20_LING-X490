The reason protestors have no control over their destiny is because of the nature of their activism. Mass protests are easy to defeat for any political officeholder , especially a government with an ideology ( such as Iran ) . A ruler is suffering a temporary staining of his image ( Deng Xiaoping is known for unleashing Chinese growth , not for Tiananmen Square ) and a hit to the budget 's revenues. In contrast , the masses are foregoing the very incomes they need to survive. It should be obvious that the ruler has enough room to simply wait for the protests to die down. When protests do succeed , it is because the ruler caves in to external pressures or personal concerns ( he may want to emigrate or go into exile ) , or seeks to appease the protestors , but return or place friends in power. The latter is what happened in Tunisia ( where the new government is essentially the same ) and what I suspect is happening in Egypt ( where power is likely to remain in the hands of the army ) . As such , I think it 's important to realise that Mubarak gave up power , he was n't deposed at all .
