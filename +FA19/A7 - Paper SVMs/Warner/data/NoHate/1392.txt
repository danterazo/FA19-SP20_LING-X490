Back from Canada 2008-08-06 I was in Canada , Toronto specifically , seeing Nine Inch Nails perform some self-indulgent whining for $ 80. Hey , I 'm able to drink without a fake ID up there , so whatever. As such , I 'm burning off a lot of booze review articles both because I had a fair amount to drink there and this shit is easy to write. Far easier than anything of substance anyway .
