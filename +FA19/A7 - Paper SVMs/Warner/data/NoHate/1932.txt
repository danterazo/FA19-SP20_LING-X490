Shabbat 133B II.1. A. Suck [ out the wound ] : B. Said R. Pappa , " A Surgeon who did n't suck out the wound - that is a source of danger , and we throw him out. " C. So what else is new ? Obviously , since we are prepared to desecrate the Sabbath on that account , it is certainly dangerous not to do it ! D. What might you have supposed ? That this blood is stored up. So we are informed that it is the result of the wound , and in the status of a bandage and cumin : Just as when one does n't put on a bandage and cumin , there is danger , so here , too , if one does n't do it , there is danger.
