Mr. Eng , good you recognize inequalities. As an Asian American , I ca n't stand people who think it 's ok to treat someone unfairly because of race . My dad is one of those people , but I do n't like to argue with him , he 's old and not in the best of health. There seems to be more tolerance among younger generation than the old and unfortunately , U.S. is run by corporations. Many American corporations are very conservative particularly in the entertainment industry. There are still some Hollywood filmmakers and some Hollywood studios like Paramount , 20th Century Fox , Columbia Pictures ( which is now owned by Sony ) are notorious for discriminating against asians thinking no one will see a movie that stars an asian actor except for mostly martial arts. Even some Asian filmmakers like Dragonball Evo director and M Night and even Asian talent agents are not helping the cause at all to better represent Asians...they 've actually made things worse. This has always bothered me . Guy Aoki from Manaa feels Asian Americans are about 40 years behind in American entertainment industry. I 'm not sure if many white Americans are aware of this , but they are going to have to decide since they make up the majority , otherwise there 's going to be more and more liberal protest groups which could eventually lead to violence if no one does anything about this. I do n't think it 's necessary to fight back in anger , but rather , I would like to see more positive Asian groups or individuals who try their best in whatever they do that inspires others to finally understand that Asians are decent people. Again , try not to get so worked up with stupid , racist people , they 're ignorant and jealous .
