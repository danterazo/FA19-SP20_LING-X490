* In 1948 The Palestinians were asked by Arab governments to leave in order to comback after an anticipated victory. Israeli historian Benny Morris dispelled this myth a decade ago. But the reason for the departure of the Palestinians is irrelevant here , since according to the Internationl Declaration of Human Rights they have a right to return . ( See Benny Morris ' The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem , 1989 , and Edward Said 's The Question of Palestine , 1979 )
