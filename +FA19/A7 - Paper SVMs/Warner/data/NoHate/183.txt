The US system is primarily a white-based system , and it just does n't allow many blacks to fit in in higher ranking positions , unless they make a great effort to conform. The diversity tolerance just is n't there , especially under Conservative rule. I do n't think it 's a rebellion as much as they simply do n't fit in , so they end up doing things that are counter-productive to society. I really do n't blame them. It 's difficult to make something of yourself when you 're brought up in such a shitty environment ( for the most part ) . Are n't we all just products of our genetics and environments ?
