# TODO, after SPR break III
- [] URGENT: finish hate speech list
- [] Figure out differences between R-imported and Python data
    - Unix `diff`. Save train from R, use `diff`, then compare two
- [] Ask Sandra to change delimiter (?)
- [] count how often people agree
    - consider collapsing mildly + very abusive
    - look at ones with low agreement
    - consider agreement rate, that determines how far we go
    - might have to do one last round
    - Wiegand was automatic, hence uncommon false flags
- [] add other TODO items from unsorted list
