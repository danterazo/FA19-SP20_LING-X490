" Today , gas chamber witnesses are making themselves extremely scarce and the Demjanjuk trial in Israel , which once again has revealed how much false testimony is involved in the matter , has contributed to the suppression. Several years ago , it happened that I was aggressively questioned at the rear of a law court by elderly Jews who presented themselves as " living witnesses to the gas chambers of Auschwitz " , showing me their tattoos. It was necessary for me only to ask them to look me in the eyes and to describe for me a gas chamber that inevitably they retorted : " How could I do this ? If I had seen a gas chamber with my own eyes I would not be here today to speak with you ; I myself would have been gassed also. " " [ 59 ] ( Faurisson )
