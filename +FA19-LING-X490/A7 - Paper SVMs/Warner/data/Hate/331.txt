Asia , while concentrated with states opposed to America in varying degrees ( Russia , China , North Korea , Myanmar , etc. ) also remains complex . The not-so-dormant nationalisms of each people will no doubt erupt over any attempt to change the status-quo , as is seen with the recurring troubles over Taiwan and the recent dispute over the Senkaku Islands . While the issue should be whether each state wishes to serve Zion or not , the arising conflict ( whether political , economic and military ) will be confused for a dualistic battle of nationalities. Asia , and East-Asia in particular , is the perfect case-in-point for the effectiveness of divisive tactics in preserving the domination of Zion .
