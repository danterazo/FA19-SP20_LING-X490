Since the Jewish media obviously is n't going to give a fair hearing to the 911 event , I thought I 'd devote a little more attention to it here . All the major networks delivered up some kosher remembrance to 911 without scratching the surface of all the suspicious little details . Maybe tracking down the real criminals and bringing them to justice would be a better way to remember the victims .
