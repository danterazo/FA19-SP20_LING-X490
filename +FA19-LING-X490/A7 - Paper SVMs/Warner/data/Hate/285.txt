The Muslims beat up the Jewish employee in residence , but not to worry , the NY Times says " briefly beat , " so I guess that 's OK. I wonder if a Times reporter were beaten by these marauding savages if it would be described the same way as when a Jew is beaten. Is " briefly beaten " anything like " briefly killed " ?
