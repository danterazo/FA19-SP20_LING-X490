David Lane was captured on March 31 , 1985 in North Carolina and was extradited to Seattle. Lane and nine other Order members were tried and convicted under the RICO ( Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ) statutes. In a separate trial , three Order members , one being David Lane , were tried and convicted of violating the civil rights of Alan Berg , however no one to date has been charged with the actual shooting of the kike. All in all , David Lane was charged with 190 consecutive years on charges that included racketeering , conspiracy , and violation of Berg 's civil rights. 150 of these years were for the " violation of Berg 's civil rights " alone , and no one was ever formally convicted for his actual murder. For most people this might have been where the story ended , but fortunately for all of us in the movement , David was still far from done in his work .
