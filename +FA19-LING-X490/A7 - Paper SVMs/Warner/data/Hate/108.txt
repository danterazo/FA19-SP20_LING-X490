The great Pope Gregory VII writes in a letter to King Alfonse VI of Castile in the year 1081 , " We exhort your Royal Majesty , not to further tolerate , that the Jews rule Christians and have power over them. For to allow , that Christians are subordinated to Jews and are delivered to their whims , means to oppress the Church of God , means to revile Christ himself. "
