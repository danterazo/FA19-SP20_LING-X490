" Not a single solitary sound reason has yet been advanced for putting the Ku Klux Klan out of business. If the Klan is against the Jews , so are half of the good hotels of the Republic and three-quarters of the good clubs. If the Klan is against the foreign born or the hyphenated citizen , so is the National Institute of Arts and Letters. If the Klan is against the Negro , so are all of the states south of the Mason-Dixon line. If the Klan is for damnation and persecution , so is the Methodist Church. If the Klan is bent upon political control , so are the American Legion and Tammany Hall. If the Klan wears grotesque uniforms , so do the Knights of Pythias and Mystic Shriners. If the Klan holds its meetings in the dead of night , so do the Elks. If the Klan conducts its business in secret , so do all college Greek letter fraternities and the Department of State. If the Klan holds idiotic parades in the public streets , so do the police , the letter-carriers , and firemen. If the Klan 's officers bear ridiculous names , so do the officers of the Lambs ' Club. If the Klan uses the mails for shaking down suckers , so does the Red Cross. If the Klan constitutes itself a censor of private morals , so does the Congress of the United States. If the Klan lynches a Moor for raping someone 's daughter , so would you or I. "
