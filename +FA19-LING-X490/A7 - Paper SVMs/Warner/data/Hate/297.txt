While in Tennessee and publishing ` revisionist ' material , he was seized by the police and thrown into solitary confinement in a Canadian jail [ 63 ] . After two years he was transferred to Germany , where his trial now progresses.

The letter said , in effect , that Germany had been on its knees before Zion for fifty years and it was time to get up [ 64 ] .
