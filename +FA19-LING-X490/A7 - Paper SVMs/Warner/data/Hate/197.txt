This article focuses on the short and medium term potentialities and forms of , as well as the issues associated with , an anti-Zionist alliance. In the long-term , it is important - as with all things - that this anti-Zionism transforms into Aryanism. It remains very possible that a Zionist defeat will coincide with the rise of any or all of these powers as petty Gentile rivals. This challenge ; however , remains distantly in the future and must be faced pre-emptively if this century is to be an Aryanist rather than Gentile victory .
