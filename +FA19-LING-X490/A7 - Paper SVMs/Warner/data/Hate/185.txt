There is a reckoning coming , a fulfillment of prophecy between the children of those who have departed from God and the children of those who have remained with God. It 's the war of Obadiah between Christians and jews. " And the house of Jacob shall be a fire , and the house of Joseph a flame , and the house of Esau [ jewry ] for stubble , and they shall kindle in them , and devour them , and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau , for the Lord hath spoken it " ( Obadiah 18 ) .
