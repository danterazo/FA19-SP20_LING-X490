Stephen L. Newman , arguing for freedom of expression , says that " [ h ] ate speech , by its very nature , is threatening , and all victims of hate speech have reason to fear the potential for violence that it represents. " [ ix ] He argues that special consideration for disadvantaged social groups is untenable , and that those who defend legislation prohibiting hate speech " serve only to explain the heightened sensitivity of historically oppressed groups to continuing expressions of prejudice. " [ x ] I find this statement to be highly contentious and dismissive of the real concerns of marginalized groups. It is true that hate speech can target both disadvantaged and privileged groups in society , and individuals deserve protection from these threats. However , words of hatred spoken against a person who is socially privileged does not serve to support systems of oppression that already exist against them. Socially privileged groups are not in the same socio-political/economic position as disadvantaged groups : the relation of power that constitutes oppression serves to advance socially privileged groups while simultaneously squashing socially disadvantaged groups. Those who are harmed by such oppression deserve protection and support as society works to undo and disentangle the interlocking systems that have created situations in which disadvantaged people are trapped between the proverbial rock and a hard place. Western society has been built on the backs of disadvantaged people , and they are still paying the price today because of pervasive beliefs involved in racism , sexism , heterosexism , etc. Hate speech , when aimed at the socially privileged , is as harmful as a dent in a suit of armour. For a disadvantaged group , it is a kick in the teeth while they 're already down .
