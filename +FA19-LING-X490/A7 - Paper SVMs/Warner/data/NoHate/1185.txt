In the Criminal Code of Canada ( CCC ) , anyone who promotes genocide , incites hatred of an identifiable group in a public place , or promotes hatred is guilty of a criminal offence and will be imprisoned for two to five years. [ ii ] The CCC states that " In th [ ese ] section [ s ] , " identifiable group " means any section of the public distinguished by colour , race , religion , ethnic origin or sexual orientation. " [ iii ] Note that this definition excludes gender , disability , and economic status. Also , identifiable groups are recognized by Section 15 ( 1 ) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms ( CCRF ) : " Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and , in particular , without discrimination based on race , national or ethnic origin , colour , religion , sex , age or mental or physical disability. " [ iv ] ( Note that this list excludes economic status and sexual orientation. ) It appears from these documents that the Canadian government recognizes that individual identity is based on group membership , and the rights of individuals can be secured through the protection of groups .
