The grand plan of the Reagan administration was two-pronged. First , it drooled at the prospect of uniting a billion Muslims around a holy war , a Crusade , against the evil empire. I use the word Crusade , not Jihad , because only the notion of Crusade can accurately convey the frame of mind in which this initiative was taken. Second , the Reagan administration hoped to turn a religious schism inside Islam , between minority Shia and majority Sunni , into a political schism. Thereby , it hoped to contain the influence of the Iranian Revolution as a minority Shia affair .
