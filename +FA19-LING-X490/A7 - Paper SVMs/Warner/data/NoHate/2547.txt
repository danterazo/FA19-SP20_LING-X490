Berry : Cicero was not blackmailed. There was no money. There were a few concerns about the rally : 1 ) it might hasten White Flight , 2 ) teachers were going to bring their classes down to the rally as a learning experience and possibly get hurt , 3 ) gangs may have used the rally as an opportunity to cause serious harm. So I decided not to go to the town. I want to see towns get help ; I do n't want to see them get destroyed .
