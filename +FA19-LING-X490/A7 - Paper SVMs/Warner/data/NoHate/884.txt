The following is an outline of the picture which the organization will present : From the municipal administration up to the government of the Reich , the People 's State will not have any body of representatives which makes its decisions through the majority vote. It will have only advisory bodies to assist the chosen leader for the time being and he will distribute among them the various duties they are to perform. In certain fields they may , if necessary , have to assume full responsibility , such as the leader or president of each corporation possesses on a larger scale. In principle the People 's State must forbid the custom of taking advice on certain political problems - economics , for instance - from persons who are entirely incompetent because they lack special training and practical experience in such matters. Consequently the State must divide its representative bodies into a political chamber and a corporative chamber that represents the respective trades and professions. To assure an effective co-operation between those two bodies , a selected body will be placed over them. This will be a special senate. No vote will be taken in the chambers or senate. They are to be organizations for work and not voting machines. The individual members will have consultive votes but no right of decision will be attached thereto. The right of decision belongs exclusively to the president , who must be entirely responsible for the matter under discussion. This principle of combining absolute authority with absolute responsibility will gradually cause a selected group of leaders to emerge ; which is not even thinkable in our present epoch of irresponsible parliamentarianism . The political construction of the nation will thereby be brought into harmony with those laws to which the nation already owes its greatness in the economic and cultural spheres .
