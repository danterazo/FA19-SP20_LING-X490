One evening , in a quiet seaside town in northern Massachusetts , Marco Tejeda pulled a black ski mask over his face and knocked on the front door of a single-family home.

Tejeda seized some cash and some prescription medication before fleeing. Tejeda was a legal immigrant--his father works for the Dominican consulate .
