If people still think slit eyes belong to Asian people only , they are really uncivilized and uneducated , I saw some Western people have slit eyes as well , but not ugly , pretty sexy to me. And I think nobody is " pure breed " nowadays , so totally can not say what facial or body structures exclusively belong to what nations , color is huge different from each other of course. I also found Asian people are beautiful , well , some of them , and some of them are gross , maybe they were born to be fat and do n't know how to dress which make them more worse , one thing I can not stand is fat ugly chicks with horrible glasses. But anyway , every nation has it 's hot people and gross people , which is fair enough. I love Asian , I 'm proud to be born in an Asian country , but I do n't love my own people too much , because it seems they are not proud of themselves , no wonder it 's always being ruled by other neighbor countries. Yes , they love white people , white culture , does n't mean I hate white , but how come my people always try to be others , why they speak English to their kids even they themselves can not speak English properly ? Why they prefer White men teachers to teach their kids which Asian teachers can do the same ? They may say Asian teachers have accent , but I do n't think so , even having so called " Asian " accent , it 's better than people who fake their accent try to be someone else which is not natural and totally fake. I hope people from my nation will change , just to be themselves .
