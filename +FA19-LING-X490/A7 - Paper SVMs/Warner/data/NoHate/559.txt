Bawer [ referring to homosexual anti-islamist Bruce Bawer ] is probably not the right person to work as a bridge builder. He is a liberal anti-Jihadist , and in many ways not a culturally conservative. I have my suspicions about him being TOO paranoid [ with reference to his homosexuality ) . It could seem as though he fears that ` cultural conservatives ' will become a threat against homosexuals in the future . Therefore he refuses to take his chance to influence them into a positive direction ? That seems completely irrational .
