Also , I doubt very much the protests in Libya would have been as well-supported if it were n't for its coverage internationally. Certainly there are many disgruntled with Gaddafi who would protest , especially with the protests across the Arab world. However , I think this has been aided by US diplomatic support for Egypt 's protestors. Additionally , the reality of the magnitude of the protests - and their importance as a threat to Gaddafi - is without a doubt magnified beyond reality. This is probably a reactive measure from the US , which is their attempt to maintain the image of the Arab world 's protests as truly democratic expressions , by highlighting the protests in enemy states such as Libya and Iran , and drowning out those in Jordan and elsewhere. This has taken the form of widely broadcasting Iran 's support for the protests , but its ` crackdown ' on ` its own ' protests. The same is true of Libya , with a lot of attention placed on Gaddafi 's fiery and militant rhetoric against the protests .
