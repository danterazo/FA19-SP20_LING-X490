There 's so much hatred and racism. I ca n't understand it. I 'm a Jew , and I DONT hate Arabs , I try to walk a righteous path. I 'm against what the jews did in the biblical days , But we 're not living in those days anymore. WE NEED TO MAKE PEACE. The Jews then are n't the Jews today. You can hate the Israeli goverrnment , but do n't hate the Jews. WE 'RE JUST PEOPLE ! ! !
