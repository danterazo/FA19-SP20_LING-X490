These intellects do n't have a theory because the most rational theory - that foreigners are what breeds fear of foreigners , that genocide is what inspires anti-genocidal rhetoric and even violence - is unthinkable to them. At least where Whites are the victims , rather than the perpetrators. These are not the high-minded , neutral researchers they pretend to be , but partisans that either firmly believe that there is no such thing as Whites , never mind indigenous Whites , or that Whites have no legitimate cause to resist a regime - their government , media and academia - deliberately inflicting conditions that are bringing about their physical destruction .
