America 's people lived for long decades a life apart , dependent only upon Almighty God , and then as the population increased our people became more and more interdependent upon each other. We have been a homogeneous people in the main , thinking and acting alike , obeying constitutional authority in the interests of the common welfare. Today , our unity is threatened by hordes of immigrants who have sought shelter under our flag. They bring foreign ideas and ideals into our land threatening our unity through a foreign propaganda that is pouring into the hard fibers of our national character. This must be counteracted if we are to remain a united nation of Americans rather than a polyglot mob .
