I like your article. But your title contradicts with your last sentence.A love hate relationship.How complicated. Asians suck up to the Whites. It does n't happen just in America. It happens all over the world. But the whites suck up to the whites too. Do n't you see your fellow white colleague suck up to the white boss ? And you try to suck up too. It is just matching what other races are doing. It is the colour of the skin that makes it stand out as an issue. I second you on Asians trying to have British accents.I have met many people who have been brought up for 20 years speaking English in their local accent. Its awesome , flat toned unique tune was swapped for a british or American accent. It 's sad. But hey , if you are n't like that , then who cares right ? If you have your own accent or slang. Just love it.I am a Singaporean. But I speak proper English with my flat tone ,its unique & I love it. I do n't even need to throw in the Singlish slang into my spoken English to love my accent . Anw , nice observation.But it will be great if people can learn more about each other 's races and establish some sort of understanding. Instead of attacking each other all the time based on assumptions
