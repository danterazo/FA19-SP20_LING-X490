Gov. Quinn explained : " Illinois is a diverse state , which is one of our greatest strengths. There are more than 400,000 Muslims and 300 mosques within our borders , representing various racial and ethnic sects of Islam. I want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity for input in how we address issues such as education , public safety and jobs , because the strategies may need to differ based on the history , culture and needs of different communities.
