Also your gravity explanation just makes no sense. No right minded scientist would use that logic to explain how the Earth can be moved since a stone that large would exert it 's own mass. It 's the same reason why a nuclear explosion does not exert enough force to move the Earth. A better answer from an Atheist would be , " If God existed , he would increase his mass exponentially so his force would be greater than that of the force from the stone exerted against him "
