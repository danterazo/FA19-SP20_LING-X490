So Jesus said , You are of a different race , a different origin , a different background. Let me tell you about the whole Race of Israel . Turn to John 17. John records that Jesus praised the Father , and in this declaration , the Man Christ Jesus in the body is unveiling for posterity facts concerning the Eternal Spirit : " I have manifested Thy Name unto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world. Thine they were , and Thou gavest them Me,- and they have kept Thy Word .... I pray for them. I pray not for the world , but for them whom Thou hast given Me,- for they are Thine ... and Thine are Mine. "
