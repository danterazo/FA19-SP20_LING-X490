So , what day is it today ? Oh yeah , it 's Sunday. That 's right. Sunday. And what day is it tomorrow ? Monday. Yep , tomorrow is going to be Monday. And the day after that ? Well , you get the point , because by God almighty I 'm gon na be sitting here writing about it today , tomorrow , and the day after that. And when the pen gets so mighty that the sword will have no other choice than to be raised up , then all hell is gon na break loose , and the word will go out who the victor in this game is going to be - hands down , no questions asked .
