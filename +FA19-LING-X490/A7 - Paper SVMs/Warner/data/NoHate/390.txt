Given that speaking the truth about Jewish Supremacism is now considered anti-semitic , and given that Israel is now trying to extradite " holocaust deniers " to Israel or other places where they can be imprisoned , it is time to bring these issues out into the open and to give dissenting citizens of Jewish extraction the right to be heard and demonstrate that we too understand the problem of Jewish Supremacism and in no way support its warlike and police state policies. It is ironic that Zionist Russian mafia criminals are given safe haven in Israel which refuses to extradite them , yet Israel 's new law demands the right to extradite " thought criminals. " Apparently , truth is not considered to be a valid defense when discussing anti-semitism. Therefore , we are entering a twilight zone which requires the efforts of honest citizens or the truth may not survive these lies .
