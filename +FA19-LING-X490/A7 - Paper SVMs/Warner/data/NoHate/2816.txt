At Nuremberg , the German war-generals as well as being tortured had their wives arrested , to dissuade them from making inappropriate remarks in court. They were kept in solitary confinement to prevent their comparing notes , as each was presented with the Great Untruth and asked to believe it. Finally , most of them were hanged , by a court which felt free to invent new laws , and to act as prosecutor , judge , lawyer and executioner : American justice !
