I 'm NOK much later in the game than him when I have only been politically active for 13 years. I fo/rstegenerasjonsdhimmi ( Generation Y ) . I was active Oslo FrP / FpU in the first 6-7 years ( in the cultural conservatives + laissez faire capitalist / liberal camp ) and contributed to the Progress Party 's success before I stopped. I felt the time was more important to help develop / promote the political doctrines abroad especially British , German , French , American ) . I ran the business a few years while I studied and earned a few million so I could finance a inntektslo/s politically active life. I now use these funds to be able to work full time to further develop / promote the Vienna Academy ( Vienna school of thought ) that Fjordman , Bat Yeor , Spencer + many others have already contributed so much till. The last three years I worked full time with a cultural conservative works that will help to further develop / promote these political doctrines further .
