The reason to consider hate speech on the part of one marginalized group against another is this : on what basis do you suppose that these laws will be actually applied fairly , and with accurate judgment on the relative marginalization of groups ? I can easily see societies using these laws as another means to pit one group against another - suppressing hate speech by a less favored group against another , more favored - but still marginalized - group. It is easy for a society as a whole to assert that one group is marginalized , and thus deserving of protection , even though it really is n't. Divide and conquer is a traditional means of maintaining power , and arbitrary , capricious suppression of some speech is an excellent way to divide .
