We are too short-sighted about who we as humans really are in the big picture and about what is important. We are all the same. Racial and cultural differences are and have always been small and transitory when looked at in the long view. I 'm not saying they should be ignored from a historical or societal standpoint , but to keep score about whose marrying who and to imply that mixing is bad is silly .
