The third most powerful man at AOL-Time Warner , at least on paper , was Vice Chairman Ted Turner , a White Gentile. Turner had traded his Turner Broadcasting System , which included CNN , to Time Warner in 1996 for a large block of Time Warner shares. By April 2001 Levin had effectively fired Ted Turner , eliminating him from any real power. However , Turner remained a very large and outspoken shareholder and member of the board of directors .
