Secondly , the statement that the United States has " allowed " Israel to consistently dominate the Middle East is similarly absurd. Israel has the most successful economy ( the GDP per capita of Gulf States is larger ) and is the most technologically advanced society in the region , but realistically , this is a nation with a population of 7 million on a tiny piece of land with an overall GDP the size of Hungary 's or Finland 's . Placed within Europe , it would be a minor power at best. If it does dominate the region , its strength is more a testament to the weakness , division and economic ills of it 's neighbors. Egypt , which also receives an immense amount of US aid , has a GDP per capita lower than that of El Salvador. Even , if a solution were reached to the Palestinian conflict tomorrow , this gap between Israel 's modern dynamic society and the moribund Arab economies ( again with the partial except of the Gulf States ) would remain .
