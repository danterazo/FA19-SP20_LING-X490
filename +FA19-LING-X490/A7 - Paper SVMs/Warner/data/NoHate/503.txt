In early May of 2007 , after enduring inhumane and neglectful treatment by the Federal Bureau of Prisons staff , David Lane eventually began suffering from health problems. He was supposed to have been sent to a medium security facility where he was to receive much needed dental work . Instead , David a 68 year-old man in poor health , was shackled and chained and sent to a maximum-security prison in Indiana where he was locked away with terrorists and criminals. He was n't receiving any of his medications and due to improper dental care could no longer eat food without enduring unbearable pain. Due to these circumstances a once strong man was then weakened and frail. Three weeks after arriving at Terre Haute , David Eden Lane was found dead in his cell on May 28 , 2007 .
