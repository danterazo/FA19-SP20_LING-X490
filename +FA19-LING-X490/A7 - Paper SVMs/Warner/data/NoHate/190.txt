The current austerity programs being implemented in Europe are at the core of a lessening of moderate/centrist political hegemony which has prevailed recently , and the moderate socialism it is influenced by. While it differs from country to country , there is an increasingly public expression of the belief of the masses that the policies of their respective nations have failed ( besides merely blaming the banks ) . This is largely a result of the waning of the perception of progression ( mostly determined by economic growth ) , causing Europeans to turn inwards , as the frustrations of ethnic-Europeans come to the surface . Essentially , the patriotic tribalism promoted by the political establishment for decades included these ethnic-Europeans and immigrants against ` the others'. Recently this even came to include all of the EU 's population in the minds of some. However , as the pie shrinks due to a depressed economic situation , this tribalism will turn nationalistic , as the ethnic-Europeans compete against the immigrants for greater political , social , cultural and economic dominance. This is natural for any tribalistic group , but will be magnified by the Zionists .
