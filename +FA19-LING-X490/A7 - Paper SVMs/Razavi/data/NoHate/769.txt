Here in comp.os.os2.misc , spake unto us , saying : Here it has turned into a nightmare. I got increasingly bizarre error messages and the system is now totally wedged. HOW DO I BACK OUT of a fixpack from the text-mode command line accessible early at boot time ? The system wont go any further. Sorry , Pierre this isnt necessarily directed at you , and I know it isnt directly helpful. But why on earth do so many people insist on applying operating system upgrades without making backups ? The simple answer to your question is " restore your OS/2 boot partition from backup " , and thats all I need to know myself ( since I always take a system snapshot before messing with my OS installations ) , but in your case it is gon na be somewhat more involved. Sigh. : - ( I hate seeing people nailed by problems which are easily preventable. : - ( OS/2 + Linux + BeOS + FreeBSD + Solaris + WinNT4 + Win95 + DOS + VMWare + Fusion + vMac + Executor = PC Hobbyist Heaven ! : .for they are subtle and quick to anger .
