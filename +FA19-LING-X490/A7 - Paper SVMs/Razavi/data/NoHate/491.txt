It is for everybody who uses WIN98 ( SE too ! ) and whos joystick is listed as " not connected " . The updated virtual display driver is called sw3dpro.vxd version 3.00.01. One should also download the latest game controller software : SWGameEN.exe ( version 3.02 ) Go Here and get the joystick .vxd file and the latest game controller software. This is a MS force feeback troubleshooting FAQ page. I dont see any new , ( at least specific ) vdx or game controller software. There is one link to a file called " Swgame30.exe " . Is this the correct update-file ? Thanks , Matt -Teehole
