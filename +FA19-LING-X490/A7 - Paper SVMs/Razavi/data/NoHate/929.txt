Beer , meat and green chile are the 3 things I enjoy most in the world of food and drink. I will spend large amounts of money on these things as they keep me happy. Just remembered.I DO like an ale really well too. Called Fat Tire. it is brewed up in denver and therefore I can get it fairly cheap down here. Woowoo Fat Tire isnt exactly " bad , " in fact it is pretty good , but are you telling me that you like their ale better than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale ? -Zac Bryan While you are equating these pleasures with sin I will be enjoying the Daughters of Men the Bonobos For your safety and protection , this sig. file has been thoroughly tested on laboratory animals
