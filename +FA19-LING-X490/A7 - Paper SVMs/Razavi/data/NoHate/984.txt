After all , the semantics of array operations can be achieved with DO loops. No , it is precisely the fact that the DO loop does _not_ express array semantics that they were included in the standard. Think aliasing and parallel operations. Everythig that array operations can do can be implemented with do loops. If this were not so , the array operations would never be implementable on scalar hardware. J. Giles
