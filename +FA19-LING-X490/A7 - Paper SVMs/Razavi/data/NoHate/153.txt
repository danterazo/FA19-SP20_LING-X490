told us. i want a program where my ip will show other people a diffrent ip address.any other tips to close netbios or sucure port 139 i did a few things but extra seercurity for itthank-you. this wont make sense. you need your ip to get answers from the internet. you can hide several local machines behind a server with NAT or ip-masq and maybe your provider offers similar things. you can block netbios-ports with a firewall. peter goldfisch.atat.at
