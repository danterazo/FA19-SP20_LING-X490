The only time that exist is now. How true. Now is all there is. The idea that time is some thought of line in which one travels in one direction or naother is a conceptual disaster. If you are standing by a passing train , part of it is in your past , part in your " now " and part in your future : This may have been posted as humor but it evoques in my mind an interesting concept.

In the case of a particle that is not moving , both states are equal. I believe this because I am a dualist , in the sense that I subscribe to the yin-yang notion that nothing can exist unless its opposite also exists. Louis Savain Before you buy .
