Standing in a doorway is a poor choice in context to surviving a strong earthquake. Doors swing wildly in an earthquake. Anyone standing in a doorway during a quake could be pummeled severely by a swinging door especially if the door is substantial and the earthquake is strong. Placing oneself under a heavy desk or table , and holding on to that desk or table , is a more reliable course of action although there is no one action which offers complete protection or guarantees survival.
