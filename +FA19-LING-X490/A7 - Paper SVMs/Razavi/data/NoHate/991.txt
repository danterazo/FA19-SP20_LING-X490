A question just occurred to me How come all of these Hollow Earth advocates never go to this big huge hole in the ground themselves ? You know , snap a few shots , take a few samples , and then come back and stun the scientific world ? Is there a reason that they make their claims solely on the basis of satellite photos with missing data and third ( or more ) hand reports of long dead explorers ( which were probably fabricated in the first place ) ? Phillips One of your " long-dead explorers " was Adm. Richard E. Byrd who came of a distinguished Virginia family and who ( so far as I know ) had nothing in his history that would indicate a predisposition to fabrications of any sort. You ask why there have been no photographs. This may be because you are under a misapprehension about just exactly what you would see there. You seem to think that , as one treks northward and finally gets sufficiently close to the Pole , one would come to a gigantic circular abyss where below all was blackness and into which one dare not fall. Try to realize that the crust at the opening could have a radius of the order of a thousand miles. Thus it would be perfectly to walk around this crust and have no sense whatever of having traversed anything other than flat ground. it is very dangerous. You might fall in and never get out , and many scientists believe that the underground caverns are full of dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs. It is the same reason that astronauts are never sent to photograph black holes. Oh , come now ! Tarzan was able to make it in and back with his expedition. They just used a dirigible and it worked fine g. Gene Horr trarubee ng fjoryy qbg arg ROT13 to reply
