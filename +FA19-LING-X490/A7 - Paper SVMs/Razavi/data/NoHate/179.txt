there is your explanation as to why the nucleus doesnt blow apart.

I have given repeated examples , as have many others. Want to get back to discussing your new theory of line spectra instead of ranting ? Well at least show me where you think it fails in regards to the fusion of two deuterium atoms in collision , using my model. . A considerably large number of chemical reactions involving deuterium happen probably every day. I have never seen any paper where people are a bit puzzled because they found a bit of helium in the mass spec of their product.
