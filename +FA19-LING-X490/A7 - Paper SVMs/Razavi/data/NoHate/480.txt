It seems that quite a bit of the " who would win in this situation " type of post in this newsgroup come down to a disscussion of BJJ/judo vs. other arts. A lot of the posts seems to favor BJJ in a fight , citing that most fights end up on the ground. I very recently starting studying Shorin-Ryu Karate , and from what I understand it emphasizes striking and kicking , with not as much emphasis on throwing and grappling. My question is this : where does this leave me in a conflict with a grappler ? More specifically , where would this leave someone practicing Shorin-Ryu when fighting a non-martial arts high-school/college wrestler ? Again , I just recently started in the martial arts , and I just as recently started reading this newsgroup , so if this topic has already been covered to the point of exhaustion I didnt know it. Sorry to drag it up again. And thanks in advance for any replies. Scott It will mostly come down to the way you fight your opponent. If you fight a boxer like a boxer with limited boxing skills he will eat ya up and spit ya out. The same goes for the grappler. If you let him get into you without hurting him real bad you are going to get tore up and left broken and wondering how he did this to ya. When I refer to grapplers I am talking BJJ , Judoka and wrestlers.Like fighting a boxer , if you go to the ground against any of these three arts youll get eaten up and spit out. I am not saying the art youve taken isnt good for self defense because you can take lots of people out with a good kick , punch , elbow , knee or head butt. Besides , good boxers or grapplers dont really go around terrorizing our neighborhoods. Mallen
