But what is it bouyant in ? Could not anti-gravity be a form of bouyancy within the field of gravity ? If not exactly by definition at least by appearence. Of course I am not saying this is what is going on , just pointing out that you should be more clear. If this is indeed what is going on it would still be seen as a great breakthrough. Hello , we are three physics students at the University of Erlangen-Nuernberg in Germany , and in our free time , we have tried to reproduce an alleged " antigravity " experiment. Maybe some of you have heard of Podkletnov , who reported to have measured a " gravity shielding " effect about a huge , rotating superconductor. As often broadcasted in the German TV , there is also a simplified version of the experiment , called Schnurers experiment. At the URL we give a report about our 2 weeks of attempts to reproduce Schnurers gravity shielding effect. Our result : The effect is not antigravity at all , it is simply bouyancy. We are no professionals ( at that time , we did not even know how to calculate the average error etc. ) , but the result is quite obvious , and maybe the web site is interesting for those who have been heard of these antigravity experiments before. Sincerely , Markus Mueller
