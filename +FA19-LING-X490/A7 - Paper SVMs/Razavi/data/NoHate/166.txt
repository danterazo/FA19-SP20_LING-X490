This has long been a bone of contention with me as well. What my DAT reads as an " over " is not what my other DAT reads as an " over " , and then , my computer program is also different all of this when making D-D transfers. I agree that there should be some standardization , and unless I am missing something , it sure doesnt seem like this would be too difficult to implement. Hey , once you are in the digital domain , you are keeping it that way , right ? the levels should display equally on any display. Except that " digital " meters on most digital gear arent digital at all. 0db on my Tascam doesnt always read 0db on my Sony , Akai , etc when making D-to-D transfers. If the meters on affordable gear actually read real bits instead of reading pre-ADC analog then levels would display equally on any display. Do the meters on " unaffordable " gear read real bits ? Just curious , Scott ! Ken/Eleven Shadows/d i t h er , who likes to slam the mix onto DAT to get that really cool digital compression " Irian Jaya " and " Sangsara " CDs now available ! Real Audio !
