[ A complimentary Cc of this posting was sent to Trevor Hemsley The CD filesystem does not include support for EAs so they are discarded when you write files to a CD ( probably not even written at all ) . The only way to get EAs onto a CD that I know of is to zip the files first using an EA aware copy of zip and then write the zip file to CD. I wonder how hard would it be to write a FS on top of the CDFS , which would store EAs of a " filename.ext " in a file " filename.ext. e a " , and will do the inverse transformation on reading. It is possible to stack one FS on top of another , right ? Ilya
