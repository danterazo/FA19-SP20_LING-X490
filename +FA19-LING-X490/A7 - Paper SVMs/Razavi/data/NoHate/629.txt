I have a friend who is a 41 y/o recovered drug addict. He has been , in the past , diagnosed with several mental illnesses , and several medications regimens , but generally , he is done best on no meds at all. Now , he is on bromocriptine mesylate to increase the dopamine in his brain which they think is deficient due to his long history of drug abuse. I find nothing on this subject , except parkinsons disease , and lactation. The story is that there is a studying going on somewhere to evaluate this medication for this use. Can you please advise me as to who is doing this study ? Thank you very much. Life is not a dress rehearsal. Before you buy .
