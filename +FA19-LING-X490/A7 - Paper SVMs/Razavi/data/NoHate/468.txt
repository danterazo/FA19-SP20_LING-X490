OS20MEMU works fine here with Warp 4 FP11. Michael OS20MEMU is not gon na work on Warp 3 beyond FP 17. Period. It was well documented by IBM at the time and was the final straw that drove me to Warp 4. ( Note that this is probably over 2 years by now. ) Following is my experience. YMMV. If so I would like to know. Whether OS20MEMU works on Warp 4 is not dependant on FP level ; it is dependant on how much RAM youve got. I am at FP9. Up until a month ago I had a 486DX2 with 24M on a Zeos Gosling MB. OS20MEMU worked flawlessly. I swapped out the old MB for a Soyo 5EHM K6-III 400 with 128M. OS20MEMU stopped functioning. Unlike the Warp 3 case where it displayed error an message that it was not gon na work , in this case it simply fails to produce any useful output. I dont think this is true. What I found was that one of the IBM1S506.ADD releases ( and those do come in the fixpacks , too ) broke OS20MEMU ! To get it working again , use , for example , the DANIS506.ADD replacement , or get an SCSI system : , or use an older IBM1S506.ADD if you only have smaller IDE drives , so that you dont need the fixes in the newer releases of that driver. I think the problem is the zombie DOS VDM that is started by the newer IBM1S506.ADD drivers at initialisation , but can not prove this. I once had a very short newsgroup conversation with Sam Detweiler about this , must have been 1997 or so , when the problem started even with Warp 4 ? I didnt try it on my new machine ( 128 MB RAM , SCSI only ) , but I shall do this soon , and report back if it fails. Assume it works if you dont see me posting again. Regards , MQ __ Institut f.
