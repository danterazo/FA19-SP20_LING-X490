Dunno about online ( havent checked ) . But another book you might want to see is " Symplectic Techniques in Physics , " by V. Guillemin and S. Sternberg. Most of the first chapter is devoted to matrix methods in optics ( then it goes on to Fresnel optics , and ultimately to quantum mechanics ) . it is a splendid little book. I dont remember the publisher , though might be Cambridge or Princeton press. The publisher is Cambridge University Press. Another book you may want to see is " a course in mathematics for students of physics " volume 1 , by Paul Bamberg and ( again ) Shlomo Sternberg. Chapter 9 is devoted to Gaussian optics using matrices , and differential forms. The chapters about 25 pages long , so it is only an introduction .
