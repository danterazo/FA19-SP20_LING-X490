If I understand correctly you want to force the user to enter something into a textbox in the lostfocus event of the textbox. if Text1 = " " then Text1.setfocus endif if you want the user to be able to use other controls but return focus to the textbox after being clicked you will have to set the focus back to the textbox at the end of each sub. Craig Is there a way to have a control ( TextBox ) that keep the focus on the form even if I click on other controls on the form ? For example , a TextBox that represent a number and all other controls refers to that number , I would need to keep the focus on the TextBox until something is written in it. Etienne Charland
