Max , wr in stands for Western Region When the Shaking Stopped , The Work Began For USGS Scientists Well , it is 3 : 15AM , the shaking stopped a half hour ago , and I still cant get through to any wr.usgs.gov sites. The TV stations are still on the air and none have said anything about it , so I am going back to bed just generally displeased. I believe CalTech shuts down their sites to prevent preliminary info from being given out. Luckily , they forgot to tie down the finger side of the house. : So go to : Thanks , I will keep this. Somehow I knew there was stuff out there for those in the know , but being awakened by an EQ , I just couldnt think of ftp. : ) I can tell you that the USGS does not shut down the wr server to keep earthquake data out of the publics hands. wr stands for water resources , which is different from the quake server .
