( referring to ) Lets celebrate a VICTORY of world citizens against industrial giant Monsanto Company a victory against Terminator Technology , and for farmers rights and food security worldwide ! it is a victory for the activists all right. Whether it is a victory for farmers or consumers is extremely doubtful. Farmers would have had their choice as to whether to use the technology or not. Now they do not have this choice , because of people who think they know what is best for them. Terminator technology is worse than having to upgrade software every now and then. The software doesnt " terminate " but it doesnt work as well. It is of great benefit to Microsoft , and to a lesser extent Apple , and other SW producers. Tell us your precise understanding of terminator technology. I am not sure if " farmer " is a fair description of the users of genetically modified seeds which require a high degree of mechanization. The average American farm is now just about 500 acres. Farmers use a high degree of mechanization. Look at my web page Among other things it contains a 1921 ad for a tractor. The slogan was " Keep the boy in school " . Anyway , human beings , being what they are , rightly or wrongly , will not buy a type of food if they know it has foreign genes which produce a pesticide or herbicide in it. it is not going to happen. Almost all plants produce pesticides naturally and many produce herbicides. Have you thought about why grass doesnt grow under pine trees ?
