snip OS2 depends mostly on hardware vendors to write drivers compatible with OS2. Fewer & fewer now do that as OS2 loses market share. If you choose OS2 you need to make a careful selection of a video adaptor card in particular. snip Actually it is my impression that the opposite is the case ! The holes in the support , ex : the Creative Labs support , is old news , their last dricer was a AWE64-ISA Beta ! Live long and prosper. _ Peter Jespersen , Team OS/2 Denmark Consciousness : that annoying time between naps .
