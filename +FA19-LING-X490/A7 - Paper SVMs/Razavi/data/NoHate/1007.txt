[ snipped ] FreeBSD is your father. The strict disciplinarian , " Our default shell is Not BASH ! We do things the BSD way , and so will you. " Linux is that cool uncle that makes sure you have fun , but when you look carefully he is keeping a close eye on you to make sure all your shenanigans are safe. Linux and FreeBSD are , in many ways , complimentary and in some ways competitory. IMHO FreeBSD and Linux are brothers , advocating one is the same as advocating the other. Having the source , being able to see the kernel , warts and all , is vitally important to a 24/7 system. I dont care. Linux or FreeBSD , granted there are some technical differences , but , from a development perspective , I still have all the source and all the tools. Cool.
