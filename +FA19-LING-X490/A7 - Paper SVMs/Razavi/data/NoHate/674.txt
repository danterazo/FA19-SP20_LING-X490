I am trying to set of a session whereby the user is on-line already and fills in text boxes on a form which lumps the text box data together and places it all in an Email body and posts it , all in the background. Whats the simplest way to do this ? I have been trying to get the MAPI controls working but if I set the MAPI new session to False I get an error and setting it to True kicks of the Microsoft Mail Controls as a second session. Not useful if already on-line with an ISP. We also have a commercial package which includes components for SMTP , POP3 and MIME which would make things considerably easier to deal with. Amongst the samples included are two that will show an email client that has both send and receive capabilities , and that decodes MIME encoded files and saves attachments. You can download the SocketTools package from our website at David
