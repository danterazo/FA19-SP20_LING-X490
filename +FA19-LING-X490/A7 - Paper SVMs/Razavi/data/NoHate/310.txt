Should definitely be on the list of the most important persons of the 20th century. By the way has anyone noticed that A&E is doing a " People of the Millenium " series based on the 100 most important people of the past 1,000 years ? they have been giving hints as to who is on it. Diana , Princess of Wales is on it ! Thats enough to make me wonder if they are nuts already. Terry Ellsworth
