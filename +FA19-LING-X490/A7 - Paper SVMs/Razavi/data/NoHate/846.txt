Doesnt matter. The Win32 bit drivers were installed by programs that needed them and not by the operating system. Win 3x didnt need nor come with them. If your thinking there is some connection between Sys 32 drivers and an install on a fast machine , your wrong. You may be confusing Fat 32 with Sys32but thats a different story. BUT. now that you brought it up. thats probably it. If the drive was formatted as a FAT 32 and then he tries to run Win31 it WILL eventually crash out. But againthats no connection to Sys32. Of course with the 32 bit drivers. Most later programs used them Would not have any bearing on the question. Ummhmmm. Does " Gordon D. Anderson " who asked the original question or his Windows 3x installation know that ? Win 31 does NOT have any problems with speed of 450 or higher. Use it everyday on different machines all + /- 450. Ummhmmm. With or without Win32S ? Alan Computers and people only do what you tell them to do , not what you intended to tell them to do.
