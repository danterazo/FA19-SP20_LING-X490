And Really if you could actually GET the flu from the vaccinewhat is the big deal anyhow ? it is not life threatening unless you are immune system is severely weakened or you are really sick to begin with. I agree with WCit is safe and effective ( the FDA wouldnt allow it to be used if it wasnt ) LOL And hepatitis B vaccine looks a good one for safety. Dont forget to take John " whale " advised : Avoid taking the vaccine ( url snipped ) Well dude , I am a health care professional , and work administering anesthesia. It is my opinion that anyone who cares for people who are ill should take it. I have taken flu vaccine every year since it became available. I have managed to reach my late sixties , so it isnt exactly lethal. I am convinced it is safe and effective. will
