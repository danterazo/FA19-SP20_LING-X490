I have a grandfather clock. Since you all seem to be wondering around , I will ask this question thats been on my Lifes Mysteries list. Will my grandfathers clock keep the same time on the moon ? For small amplitudes , the period of its pendulum is given : T = 2Pisqrt ( L/g ) Where L = the pedulums length g = acceleration due to gravity From this you can draw your own conclusion , simply by asking yourself the question is the moons gravity the same thing as that of the Earth , all other things being the same. I know that. But it is always been that little critter g that keeps me thinking. I mean , what if it comes out right just because it happens to be a good number ? And I dont want to assume that all other things being the same. I want to know how stuff works with smaller gravity and no evident gravity. I mean , I cant believe how surprised I was when that shuttle guy dropped his tool and it fell _up_. Ever since then I have been looking at common place things and trying to figure out if different values of g would change behaviour. And then there is the rotation. How would a slow rotation affect things vs. the fast rotation of the Earth. /BAH Subtract a hundred and four for e-mail .
