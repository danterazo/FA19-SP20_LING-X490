Riccardo , If you are looking for a country in which to do some astro shopping , and you are looking to save some money.Australia is not the place. While Australia is a wonderful country , most astro stuff is imported from the US or Europe. I am told that many astro items cost twice as much in Australia as they do in the US. Al Somebody can help me ? some my co-workers will go to Melbourne for Auspak 99 expo and i would ask them to buy-me astronomical material ( i.e. eyepieces , finderscopes , mirrors. ) if the prices are lower than in Italy. For this reason i must know before some shops addresses ( in Melbourne ) and the pricelist. Could someone tell me where I could find web site concerning these sellers. Thanks , Riccardo.
