. There is a classic demonstration concerning heat : two magnifying mirrors are arranged so that light from the focus of one mirror bounces off the mirror , travels through a distance to the other mirror , and is refocussed at the focal point of the second mirror. This arrangement is called a Schlieren system , and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror , and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the " heat " radiation that is gathered by one mirror , passed through the glass , and refocussed by the second mirror. So is it a direct tranmission of some form of energy from one match to the other , or is the energy that lights the second match derived from energy transfers within the mirrors ? Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux ? Not directly. It can disturb atoms or molecules that are ferromagnetic , randomizing the orientations of their permanent magnetic moments ( their internal bar magnets ) . Would the magnetic flux created by current flowing through a non-ferrous conductor be affected by heat , assuming the conductor itself was not heated ? Assuming what ever created the magnetic flux was not influenced by the external event , what sort of events could affect a magnetic flux ? Dave Nelson
