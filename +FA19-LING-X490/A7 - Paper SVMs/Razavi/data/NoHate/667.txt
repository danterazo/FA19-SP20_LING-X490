I AM USING BORLAND C + + BUILDER3 , AND I HAVE SOME DIFFICULTIES TO IMPLEMENT A CLASS TEMPLATE FOR LINEAR ALGEBRA. FOR SAKE OF CLARITY I GIVE HERE LISTINGS OF A VERY SIMPLE AND BASIC CLASS TEMPLATE FOR WHICH THE SAME ERROR OCCURS. HERE IS THE DEFINITION OF THE CLASS TEMPLATE : templateclass Type class MyClass HERE IS THE MAIN ENTRY OF THE PROGRAM : AND HERE IS THE ONLY UNIT USED IN THE PROJECT : WHEN BUILDING THE PROJECT , COMPILER COMPLAINS ABOUT THE friend FUNCTION lin ( ) : [ C + + Erreur ] Unit1.cpp ( 8 ) : Call to undefined function lin. [ C + + Avertissement ] Unit1.cpp ( 8 ) : Structure passed by value. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN function1 AND function2 IS AN INTENTIATE b ( 8 ) OF A CLASS TEMPLATE. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAS AN INFLUENCE ON THE VISIBILITY OF THE friend FUNCTION lin ( ) ? MOREOVER , IF I EXCHANGE function1 AND function2 IN Unit1.cpp , THERE IS NO ERROR AND NO WARNING. AGAIN , I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. PLEASE , COULD YOU HELP ME TO FIND THE ERROR I DID ? OR TELL ME WHAT I DO NOT KNOW ON C + + PROGRAMMING. ANY IDEA WILL BE APPRECIATE. THANKS.
