Well if nobody else wants to say anything about Lena Zavaroni , I will. I am roughly the same age as she was and remeber her as a 10 yr old with a very mature powerhouse voice , just like a woman you wouldnt know the difference. Her appearence on the MDA telethon where she gave a rousing rendition of some " mama " song medley coupled with a very soft and smoothe " Help Me Make It Through The Night " was a knockout. Later the Carol Burnette Show with a rendition of " If They Could See Me Now " and another great performance. Never heard of her since , but what memorable impressions she made with just those two performances. Mourning her passing .
