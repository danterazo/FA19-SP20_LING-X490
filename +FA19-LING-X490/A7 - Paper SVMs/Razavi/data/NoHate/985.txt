Actually , there is no need to make that extra copy of gzip. Just create a program object pointing to gzip.exe , with " -d " in the parameters field and it will work just fine. You can have other program objects pointing to gzip.exe with other parameters ( or no parameters ) if you wish. " It depends " , I would say. There are certain tasks that require to find " gunzip " : some ported Unix apps , not to mention ( auto ) configuring Unix packages. ( If you do not no these terms , then the above approach is sufficient for you. ) Sure , but a WPS program object is unlikely to be used in this way , but rather from the command line. I just have an alias called " gunzip " that points to " gzip -d "
