Interesting problem. I am guessing that disabling the other controls until the change event in the textbox checks your condition is not an option. That would be the obvious solution. Start with other commands disabled. Private Sub Text1_Change ( ) If Not Len ( Text1 ) = 0 Then Command1.Enabled = True Else Command1.Enabled = False End If End Sub When I set the focus in the LostFocus event , we see the focus leaving and returning to it and the GotFocus and LostFocus events are raised in the other control , and it is that that I dont want.
