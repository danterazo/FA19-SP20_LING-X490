Yeah , the commentators went overboard a bit. On the BCTV news today , they showed Weekes making a routine glove save.now , usually that wouldnt be in a highlight package.but Kevin gave it the windmill and the SPLITS ! It looks cool an all.but did he really have to do the splits like that ? Lol , wasnt that the shot that would have _missed_ the net ? Jim
