It seems to me his days of " KING " .erGovernor may be numbered. I would ask first how he is faring among his constituents. I dont live in his state , and have seen no polls indicating whether or not he is losing potential votes as Governor. If his days are numbered within the Reform Party , thats something else. Pat Buchanan may be digging the Partys grave as we speak . Jay
