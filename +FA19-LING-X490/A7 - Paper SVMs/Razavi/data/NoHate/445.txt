Luc , while I know your new to these groups you should be careful about making wide claims. You said : Therefore the only way for the authors of these theories to convince the physics community would be to do some calculations which were never done before. Patently untrue. I will give you two ( but not the total derivative basis in this post , MKSC units are used herein ) . First , in the material medium model elemental charge ( e ) can be defined as Div p , where p is the momentum potential at any point in the medium ( this give it units of kg/sec ) . Now , if charge has units of kg/sec , the charge to mass ( m ) ratio ( e/m ) has resulting units of frequency. So Luc , what IS the black body temperature equal to e/m for the lowly electron ( care to take a guess ? ) . Second , with units of kg/sec we can now devine heretofore unknown relationships , like the basis for the thermal-electric coupling. A.k.a. Boltzmanns constant k is : h k = - = 1.38E-23 m-sec ^ 2 ec Yielding units of kg-m/sec ^ 3 for Kelvins ( commonly called impact ) . If you think about that , it makes perfect sense. And there are of course , several more. Because they can not do this , mainstream science is not interested and Aether theories stays on the dead branch of science on which they have been for one century. Well . Tom has explained brilliantly this kind of facts dozen of times without being able to convince etherists and I do not think I will convince them. Nope , this is mainly due to both bias and bigotry.
