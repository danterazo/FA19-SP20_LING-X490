Hello , I recently purchased a SCSI CD-RW ( Philips CDD3600 ) and I am trying to get it to work with OS/2 Warp 4 ( Fixpak 11 ) . I have installed CDrecord/2 and some GUI interfaces ( CDwrite , CDTools ) . I havent managed to get everything working yet. Anyway , I am wondering if , when I burn a data CD , the EAs for the files will be included. Also , is there any FAQ that will help me out and/or other programs that people recommend ? I also use Linux and managed to get everything going using X-CDRoast as the GUI frontend to cdrecord. I can read the HPFS partitions of Warp and write to the CD under Linux but the EAs dont seem to be there when I use the CD under OS/2. Has anyone else tried this and is there something I can do to correct this ? Thanks , Eusebio
