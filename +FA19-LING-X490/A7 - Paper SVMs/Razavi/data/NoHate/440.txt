Assume it works if you dont see me posting again. Ok , ok , here I am again. But the news arent so bad : It does work , but not with some applications. I.e. , the initial screen is displayed , the System Details screen is fine , most processes can by displayed in detail view ( F4 key ) , but it breaks down if you want to display the Netscape process ( 4.61 GA ) . In fact , this is the only app so far that will have OS20MEMU bomb out on my system ( with an unknown error in OS20MEMU.DLL , no entry in POPUPLOG ) . All O2/2 system processes including PMSHELL are fine , also WordPro , didnt try others. So it is worth a try if you can live without the fixed IBM1S506.ADD. Best , MQ __ Institut f.
