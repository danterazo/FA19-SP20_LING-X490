I have an Yamaha 02R , a Denon DNM1050R , a Panasonic SV3800 , an Alesis ADAT XT and several HHB CDR800 and the meters have different readings. The Denon seems to be the worst indicating overs prematurely , the 02R and the ADAT are relatively the same probably 1 or 2 db premature , but the SV3800 seems to be on the ball. I have never seen the over lights on the HHBs go onI wonder if the over light works ? Simon
