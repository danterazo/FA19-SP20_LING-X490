Have a look here : I dont think that Clairex have their app notes on the web yet , but you can inquire at : Paul Mathews Aengineering Co. non-contact sensor design expertise Hi there , Can anyone give me some info ( urls , articles , . ) about the use of an optocoupler ( lamp + LDR ) as a potmeter in volume control. This system is ( was ? ) used in compressors and so , because the time constant involved was very pleasant to the ear it seems. Anyone know something about this system ? TIA Tommix
