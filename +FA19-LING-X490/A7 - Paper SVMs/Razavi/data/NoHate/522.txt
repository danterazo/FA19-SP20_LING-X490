If this isnt proof of AAMTs hand in helping in encouraging work be taken out of the country , then my kids are also innocent , even though the cookie crumbs lead right to their bedroom door ! Sandy Jeesh ! I didnt want to start an argument here. AAMT is certifying CMTs from India. JAAMT has had several articles about the recent sending work over to India. If the MT work is any indication of their multiple solicitations via e-mail to my company daily , then I will pass. I got one this morning about the thread of American MTs being housewives and college dropouts. That really did not sit well with me. I just dont think that AAMT should be certifying any MT outside of the US. What is the A for in AAMT then ? Cindy in NY
