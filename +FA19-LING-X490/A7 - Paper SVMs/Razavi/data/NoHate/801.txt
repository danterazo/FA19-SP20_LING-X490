GP I think you know what I meant here . GP GP There is no Amiga program you can drag and drop to that has nested GP layers , etc like Dream Weaver2. I also use Hot Metal Pro and Homesite GP 4.01 Now add Fireworks2 and Uleads PhotImpact 5.0 , GifSaver , and other GP ULead products , plus finally Paint Shop Pro. GP GP Hard to get close to this combo on an Amiga. I wish I could , but they GP just arent there. Again have you tried MetalWeb ? I prefer a text editor myself , but for the amount of pages you do , unless you were using a preprocessor like hsc , I understand your point in making changes. However , If I am not mistaked MetalWeb does most of if not all of what you mention above. used and beta tested actually. Really good program , but have you ever seen Hot Metal Pro or Dream Weaver2 ? It is hard to imagine the ease of use if you havent.
