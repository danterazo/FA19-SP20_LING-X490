I think the problem is that most people ( myself included ) are uncomfortable with parting with money for a product which does not exist or may be delivered in an unsatisfactory , bug-ridden state. Dont forget another aspect : those of us whove grown tired of waiting for months and months on end , and have packed up and headed for more-populated waters. I pre-ordered the ParaGlide ( VTs Voodoo add-on for the Picasso-IV ) , because it seemed to make sense at the time. For me , at least , dropping more money into my Amiga just isnt reasonable anymore .
