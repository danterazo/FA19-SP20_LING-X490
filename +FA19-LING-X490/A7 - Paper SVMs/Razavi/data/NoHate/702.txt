I am going to start a design of a low cost Z80 based computer as hobby. Planned features : snip I hate to be a party-pooper , but I suspect the cheapest way to do this is to buy a bargain-basement Pentium PC and write or find a Z80 simulator for it. You get most of the peripherals built-in , and when you get bored with the project you can turn it into something at least vaguely useful : I have a very soft spot for the Z80 , as it was the machine I cut my microprocessor teeth on ; but the world has moved on since CP/M. But maybe just maybe. it could be a fun thing to do. Come to think of it , maybe I should dust-off the old Z80 CP/M box in the attic this weekend ; Jonathan Bromley I gave away my CPM computers years ago. Except for the exercise , why design another ? Don Before you buy .
