With the 800si body only , your only choice is the 6 volt lithium 2CR5 or equivilant. If you use the optional vertical grip , you have a choice of either the 6 volt lithium same as above , or 4 1.5 volt AA batteries it can take both. On Sun , 03 Oct 1999 -0400 , Viken Karaguesian Hi all. I am a bit confused about the different types of batteries available and which type ( s ) are compatible with the 800si. Right now , I just use standard lithium batteries and dont know if I would be better off using a different type. Could someone do a quick run-down of the pros and cons of the different battery types , and what would work well in an 800si ? Thanks. Viken
