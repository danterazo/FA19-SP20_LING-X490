But do you actually SEE more detail at magnifications beyond the 50x or so ( 80x for high quality refractors and long focal length high quality reflectors ) ? I know the conventional wisdom says , " No " , and in this case I am included to agree , based on views through a high quality 6 inch refractor and VERY steady seeing conditions. On a few nights over the past several years , seeing conditions at the observatory were such that on one night I could see very thin shadows on the walls of craters on the moon several hours before Full Moon. On those nights I experimented with pushing the mags past the 80x per inch aperture limit , and found that while the image was magnified , I could not see more detail on the Moon , Mars , or Jupiter ( on different nights ) . And on an SCT optical system , with that large secondary , I have not successfully seen more detail at mags much higher than 40x per inch aperture , through a C8 or a C5 + , despite excellent seeing conditions. Yes , the image was larger , but I could not see more details. So I conclude that you can save your money on short focal length eyepieces and just learn to see more details at lower mags. I am oh so tempted to add a 3mm TV Radian to my C8. It would likely be the last eyepiece I will ever buy for any scope , but used to be sure there is nothing left to see , and to occassionally get lucky. Tell me I am crazy ? Naw , you are not crazy. Under superb seeing conditions , I have used up to 1000x on my old C-8. Observed Mars with a 2.5mm Zeiss that Markus Ludes carries around in his pocket and the image was beautiful. Of course , conditions like these only comes once in a blue moon or at the Winter Star Party.
