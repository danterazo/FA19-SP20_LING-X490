Hi , I downloaded , then bought the CD. It appears to be free for the download and incredibly close to free for the CD version with all the different OSes supported. Which I find difficult to believe. Are they really giving this away ? Is there a catch other than the documentation ? If free , Why ? it is a very good group of programs. It seems to do what I need and then some with a small footprint on the hard drive. It does load slowly , but then runs rapidly ( PIII-500 with 128MB RAM ) and I assume the slow loading is due to all the pieces being loaded. Yep , does run slow on my 400 mhz PII with 64 mb. However , there is no real alternative with all the functionality. Does everything MS Office products do , plus more. File compatibility is good , and once its running , the slow down isnt too bad. Heck , for under $ 10 , why complain too loudly , right ? Go for it. You get Win32 , OS/2 , Solaris , and Linux verions all on one CD. Not a bad deal for a COMPLETE office solution with true multiplatform support ! Judith Russell Saugus Web Coordinator
