The 21st century starts on 1 January , 2001. Reference : human invention , anyway. So if most people of the world want to believe it begins in three months , thats the way it REALLY is. In fifteen months , people will change their minds and decide that 01/01/01 is ACTUALLY the beginning of the new century , new millenium. It will be another reason to party , of course. That was succintly put and probably accurate. A Janus jam. Now I feel better. Robert ( besides the Chinese calendar says the 21st century is long gone ) Regards , Steve
