MOBILTRAK uses advanced technology radio frequency scanning and detection , which logs the frequencies being tuned in by passing cars by detecting emissions from the local oscillators in the car radios. Measurement devices , called electronic measurement units ( EMUs ) are placed along busy roadways , and are capable of measuring thousands of radios in passing cars every day. When multiple units are placed in different geographical areas in a market , the combination can yield daily sample sizes in the hundreds of thousands , providing unprecedented accuracy and resolution. " Obviously , BIG BROTHER is listening.sheesh ! Now , they are finding yet another way to focus their marketing on people who listen to commercial radio. I always try to stay over on the left end of the dial ( commercial-free zone ) or put on a tape. Happy Motoring , Randy Barrow Yeah , I saw that Randy but as an electronics professional I am a bit out to lunch on how they are really doing this. Can anyone shed any light on this in more detail ? Is this local oscillator RF reaching a street corner ? What about moving vehicles ? I am dumbfounded. ( Or just dumb ) . Before you buy .
