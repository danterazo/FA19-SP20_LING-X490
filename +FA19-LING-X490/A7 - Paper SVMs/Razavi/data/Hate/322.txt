I thought that readers here on sci.skeptic and in alt.revisionism might appreciate the cowardice of Scott Bradbury aka " Doc " Tavish. Not having enough balls to respond to a direct challenge on sci.skeptic to one of his screeds , he cut and pasted a melange of out-of-context paragraphs to try and make himself and his fellow Nazis look like poor misunderstood victims , and sent copies of this to alt.religion.christian.presbyterian , alt.fans.g-gordon-liddy , alt.fans.rush-limbaugh , alt.politics.usa.republican and soc.culture.jewish. A copy of his cowardly evasion posted to soc.culture.jewish can be found at XT = 940010796.351141961 A copy of his cowardly evasion posted to alt.religion.christian.presbyterian can be found at num = 14 He has also jumped around to alt.politics.nationalism.white , alt.religion.christian,baptist , and alt.religion.christian-teen thinking that he can snare the unsuspecting in his lies and hatred. I hope that you all get a laugh at this toothless puppy who when whacked with a newspaper as he has been here , runs away yelping hoping that he will find his mommy on one of these newsgroups. For that , he would best try alt.incest-is-best. We are laughing at you Scheisdoktor Tavish ! Tim
