Just like crabs - who put up one helluva fight ! we have always enjoyed " trout-line " crabbing , catching a couple bushels in an hour or two , but alas , we sold the boat this year ( to pay for Redskin season tickets ) . No crabs. pout Sandy ( Go Skins ! ) When a lobster dies , the meat starts disintegrating. This happens even in restaurants when lobsters are cooked after they have ( recently ) died. The meat is still good as long as they havent been dead for hours , but sometimes you get a lobster that seems to have very little meat in it. That is the reason. A lobster should be alive and kicking when it goes into the pot. Rhode Islander
