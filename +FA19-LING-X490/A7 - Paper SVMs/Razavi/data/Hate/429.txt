Carol , Good luck and best wishes ! Now I am jealous of you , too. I want a house of my own ! I hate to scare you , but I hope you made sure your contractor has been in business for a long time. I would check the record as far as I could. I used to work for a home builder and some really scary things can happen with them. Also , you have to make sure that no one on the site can in any way shape or form be miscontrued as an employee of yours , because if they get hurt , they can and will sue for workmans comp. I hope you have a very sharp , very pushy lawyer working with you. steph - not really the voice of Gloom and Doom ! Boy have Trailers changed ! Steph , My MIL has a three bedroom , two bathroom double-wide that is bigger than my houseand probably cost more , too. it is gorgeous. In fact , it has pretty much the layout I want for my house. We dont really want a mobile home because of the problems we would have getting even half of a single wide through the woods to where we want to build the house. Our only choice is a site built houseand it has nothing to do with trailers because second or third rate housing. We have looked at them but in our case it isnt feasible to get one. we are not willing to tear down the fence and close to 100 trees just to get the thing in place. Carol American by birth. Southern by the grace of God .
