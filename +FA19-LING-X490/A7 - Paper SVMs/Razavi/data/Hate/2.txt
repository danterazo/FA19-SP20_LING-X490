Youve made it abundently clear by this action that you , in fact , are incapable of acting like an adult , nor should be in the company of adults. I had hoped that you , like I , were an adult who doesnt take any of this seriously and saw it as the game it is. Adults ? there is no use in calling names , Carny. I have been making this same point in various ways for well over three years now , and it is still a surprise to me how seemingly so few people " get " it.

It would please me no end if youd just get the hell away from this community , at the very least until your mommy potty-trains you.
