Van Johnson was a guest on LETTERMAN about 10 years ago or so. He was a real jerk , and he and Letterman really got into it on the air. OK,I will bite : what happened ? Johnson was in the Broadway version of " La Cage Aux Folles " and came on Letterman to plug it. He was generally nasty ; I remember him complaining that the band was too loud , so Paul played more quietly and Johnson still moaned and covered his ears as they went to commercial. While I dont watch Letterman anymore , I still base my opinion of certain celebrities on their performances on that show. The three that stick out the most are : 1. Ricardo Montalban is very gracious and engaging. 2. Crispin Glover is legally insane. 3. Van Johnson is a snotty creep. Until further evidence is reported , MattH Thanks for the info.I used to watch Letterman a long time ago but grew a bit tired of some of his childish comments.But I do recall one particular show wherin he had John Phillips ( of the Mamas and Papas fame ) on as a guest.He was promoting ( ironically it turned out ) his new book about his life and the many drug-induced problems he had gone through,which supposedly now were in the past. Phillips was high as a kite ( to put it mildly ) and Letterman ( who was quite visible angry when he realized after he began talking with Philips that he was trashed ) and the audience knew it.It was so bad that Paul Schaeffer had to leave his position in the band and come over to sit next to Phillips to ensure there wasnt a physical confrontation between him and Letterman. Phillips came across ( stoned or not ) as a complete jerk and I often wondered why the network or Lettermans people didnt edit out that part of the show. Best Wishes , Steven Celli
