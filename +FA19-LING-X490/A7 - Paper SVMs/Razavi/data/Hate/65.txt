Vidar the complascent , OK ! Looks like at least 1 person addressed every issue you have thus far addressed to this motley ng in the last month. For the answer to your current issue consult deja.com for the perenial alwaysontopSM thingy aka setwinpos mojo Bye , Neila OK , sorry if I upset you , not my intention. I got responses to my first question , thanks to Peter Mundy , but the other replies was just a great humour. I expected too much I guess , asking for a routine that would do it ! Again , sorry if anybody was offended by my last post .
