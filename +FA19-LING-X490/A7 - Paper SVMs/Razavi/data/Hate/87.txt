There is , I believe , a theorem in Alternating Current Circuit theory , which states , approximately , that the reactance of an arbitrary network of reactive elements ( inductors and capacitors ) is a monotonic function of frequency. Would someone please state this theorem more exactly , and indicate a proof ? Well you are close , but not heads on. While not Fosters Theorem , a close follow-up to Fostersa states : " Another important property of a two-terminal impedance is that the slope of the reactance with frequency is always positive. " A postive slope alone does not require the function to be monatonic , as is evident if you consider the case where resonance takes place within the network over the frequency spectrum of interest. With respect to Fosters Theorem , it states ( although I dont have Fosters literal quotation : " The entire behavior of the network is specified by giving the locations of the poles and zeros and the value of H. " ( Fosters Reactance Theorem ) . The text I have quoted here ( Walsh & Miller ) has the usual disclaimer that the proof is beyond the scope of the text. Still , what they do have is some clues to the proof. ( Make the student sweat type stuff ! ) If this would be useful to you , contact me by email and I will do my best to email the information the information to you after typing it in. ( Sorry , at 2 : 00 am , I dont do proofs ! Hell , even at 2 : 00 pm I dont do proofs. In fact , real men and scientists never do proofs. Proofs are done only by math weenies , course instructuctors trying to fill the required time , and students who are having their noses rubbed in it. Physicists dont need no steenking proofs ! God , I hope this is being posted to sci.physics or I am in big trouble ! ) Harry C .
