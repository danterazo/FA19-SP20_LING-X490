Rick , didnt that work take some organization ? Whats " organization " ? You cant just slop together a masterpiece Ever seen a Picasso ? I sure have including the special exhibit at the MOMA " Picasso and Braque Pioneering Cubism " in 1990 Picasso didnt slop anything together & anyone who thinks that has an untrained eye & doesnt know much about Art History I may not know art , but I know what I like. : ) Of course , now you know how scientists feel when some astrologers claim that there is scientific evidence in support of astrology. Religion has actually convinced people that there is an invisible man , living in the sky , who watches everything you do every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of 10 things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these 10 things , he has a special place full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever til the end of time.but he loves you.
