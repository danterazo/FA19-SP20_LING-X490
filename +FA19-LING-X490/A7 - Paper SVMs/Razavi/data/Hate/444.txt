As technology marches on , some things become obsolete. Why teach how to use a sliderule ? I dont worry about dropping certain things , I worry about not dropping enough. Why teach roman numerals ? So we can read fancy clocks and movies copyright dates ? The Bad Astronomer I sincerely hope you are being sarcastic. Yes , technology may march on , but if you start relying completely on technology , people no longer think. Thats a problem with education today , as well. Children are not being taught to THINK ! Need to calculate something ? here is your calculator. Need to check spelling ? Dont bother looking it up , the computer will catch it ( yeah , right ! ) . Dont bother to have an original thought , or question anything. Just stare at the screen and take in everything the teacher says , so you can regurgitate it later for a grade. Bullshit. I for one dont want to be so dependent on computers that I cant function without one. I spent 18 years being hand , even after getting a computer. Even now when I write I use a legal pad and a pencil. Later , it gets input into the computer. Before you buy .
