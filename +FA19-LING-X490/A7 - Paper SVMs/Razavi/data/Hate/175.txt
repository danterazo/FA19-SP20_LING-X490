SOrry to hear of the difficulties ; I used to subscribe to " Popular Electronics " and " Radio Electronics " back in the 70s and early 80s. What do you think are the weak points of the existing magazines ? Stupid projects are my personal bugaboo. I really dont want to read about battery chargers. I dislike projects that dont publish the complete specs - or that dont make source code available. The last time I browsed " Popular Electronics " on the news stand , every project schematic was ONE big processor stuck in the middle and a little bit of glue around it. BORING. More THEORY - how does it work ? More NEWS - whats coming up in the industry ? Even hobbyists want to know about fundamental stuff.sorry , glossys about a new line of .050 pitch PCMCIA connectors arent what I mean. " Wireless World " used to be good for more challenging stuff. Shucks , even Popular Electronics used to do really advanced projects before they sunk to the level of doing solar-powered sundials ( that was when I let my subscription run out ) . Keep the " computery " stuff under control , too - we dont need a PC Week clone. I dont know how anyone learns electronics at a hobby level any more.Radio Shack seems to be the last mass-market place that makes any attempt to put out the fundamental little projects from which you can learn the basics.
