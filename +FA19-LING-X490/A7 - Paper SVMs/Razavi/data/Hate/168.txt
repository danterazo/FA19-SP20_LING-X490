Subject : Re : Dr. Kerens Disinformation [ snip ] Dr. Kerens " sample of the facts " is , in this case , a wonderful example of nonsense. With regard to sample of " fact " # 6 ( above ) , one must understand that the " 500,000 " people supposedly murdered " till mid-May 1943 " simply could not have been cremated. This is hilarious ! Andrew Allen admits that the the victims of the typhus epidemic were burned on pyres , but his IHR buddy shows up for his semi-annual " it is a forgery that doesnt prove what it is supposed to prove , " all of a sudden typhus victims cant be cremated on pyres because the crematoria werent built yet. The amazing thing is that you guys think your readers are stupid enough to fall for this nonsense. In what way does your reference to the cremation of typhus victims address my concern that 500,000 alleged murder victims could not have been cremated in the ovens of Birkenau ? In what way does your fixation on the crematoria show that bodies could not have been burned at all ? at University of Alberta Multi pertransibunt & augebitur scientia " Nizkooks are not members of homosapiens. They are members of Judeosapiens. " Joe Bellinger , May 17 , 1999. [ Ceacaa comments ] The crematoria of Birkenau were a very expensive undertaking. Their construction dates are also very well documented. They are also supposed to be the epicenter of Holocaust Belief and an integral part of the German " master plan " in its most developed stage. Finally , the Germans kindly left most of the " gas chambers " of Krema II and III for us to examine. Any rational person would go to " the scene of the crime " and examine the " murder weapon " . Thus , the question becomes one of weighing Holocaust Belief against the known facts of the crematoria not , as you simplisticly try to frame the question , could the Germans really have " hidden " all the bodies some other way .
