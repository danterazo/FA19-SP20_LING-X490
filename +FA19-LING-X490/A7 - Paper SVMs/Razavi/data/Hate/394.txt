Fender Blackie Strat made out of a 50s style multiradius Warmoth neck ( maple and sooo sweet ) probably about a 12 " radius ala SRV. Black body , Kluson Tuners , Kohler Brand Vintage Trem. Amer. Standard Pickups. Sounds fatter than my Relic Strat ! MAN ! Why dont you stop calling this aftermarket parts guitar a " Fender " ? ? ? ? ? ? ? it is NOT ! it is probably better than a Fender , but it is no Fender. I thought Kohler made faucets .
