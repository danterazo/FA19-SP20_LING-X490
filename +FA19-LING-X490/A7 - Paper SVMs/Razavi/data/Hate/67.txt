Van Johnson was a guest on LETTERMAN about 10 years ago or so. He was a real jerk , and he and Letterman really got into it on the air. OK,I will bite : what happened ? Johnson was in the Broadway version of " La Cage Aux Folles " and came on Letterman to plug it. He was generally nasty ; I remember him complaining that the band was too loud , so Paul played more quietly and Johnson still moaned and covered his ears as they went to commercial. While I dont watch Letterman anymore , I still base my opinion of certain celebrities on their performances on that show. The three that stick out the most are : 1. Ricardo Montalban is very gracious and engaging. 2. Crispin Glover is legally insane. 3. Van Johnson is a snotty creep. Until further evidence is reported , MattH
