message Jemadar Ali Haidar , VC ( Pakistani soldier and Victoria Cross holder ) 15 : July in Shahu , Pakistan , aged 85 I hope they dont run out of VC holders. Well , there is that H Jones , earned one in the Falklands. BTW , what _does_ posthumous mean ? Mike Fleming I think it is when they spread fertiliser around the base of laundry posts to make the grass grow. I could be wrong about that , I am not an anthropologist like Alan Titchymarsh. btw What happened to H Jones when his voice broke ? Did they really give him a Very Cool award for that " Snowman " thingy ? Roy Archer
