a ) this was incredibly dorky b ) the former " strict " ( scientific ? mathematical ? historical ? ) definition for century marks and millennia has fallen by the wayside , and it doesnt matter. it is the same thing as the stupid-ass " emo " argument. if the overwhelming majority accept a certain meaning for a word , then thats what the TRUE meaning of that word becomes. its a normal function of natural language. BUT , why the hell cant anybody spell the word " millennium " correctly ? ? ! ? My my. What would you do if you didnt have me to disagree with Petey. what would you do if you didnt pontificate about armchair socialism on alt.punk so often ? tex , youve failed to realize that our opinions on most of these things dont differ so widely. Anyway , if you had a functioning memory youd know that I was being facetious above anyway. The last time the millennium debate was engaged in here ( at least that I participated in ) I voiced my opinion that since the determination of when the year 1 was in the common era was arbitrarily defined by a monk sometime in the 13th century there is little point in being scientific about when the millennium will turn. well i must have missed that memo. see , we agree AGAIN. thanks. pete ( buttmunch ? come on. ) _ pushovers internet repository : NOTE : this URL will soon change !
