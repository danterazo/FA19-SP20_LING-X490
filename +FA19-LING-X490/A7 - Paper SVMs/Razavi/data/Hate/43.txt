Well , what do you expect from people who are just not that smart ? I would be willing to wager that none of them have ever looked through a telescope or read any books on Astronomy. If they really had done either , they would have some doubts. Funny thing is that the Universe that God made is a lot bigger and more complex.than these poor folks can imagine ! Well. then is God less or more complex ? How come he is anthropomorphic ? Why does he care about one species living on one planet orbiting one star in one galaxy when there are are over a 100 billion galaxies ? What kind of God creates a billion billion stars and then worries about the sex lives of naked apes ? It would appear that a personal God is an Ego trip for the simple mind. D. Haas
