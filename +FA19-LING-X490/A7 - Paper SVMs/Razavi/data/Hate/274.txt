its like getting upset at ridge or thorn on " days of our lives " . What year of Days are they running in the UK ? it is Princess Gina ( a.k.a. Hope ) , Bo , Stefano , John , Marlena , Sammi Austin here. Have you gotten to Kristen yet ? LOL , i dunno , but if you ask any of my girls girlfriends , they will tell you in gory detail. : ) is " Days " the show where " patch " is back , but only without the patch ? ( days , bold and , etc all meld into one for me whenever i spot them going by ) btw , I am in australia , which , unlike what some moron was trying to tell us a while ago , is not a part of the UK nor is it under lizzys rule. ned kelly. tinhead
