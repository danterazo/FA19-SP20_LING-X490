Okay , I want some good sexy SF books. Not " spank " books ala John Norman , but rather some well done SF books where you get a little more than , " And after , they saved the Universe. " Something that should probably say " Adult " on the cover ( like Heavy Metal ) , though it doesnt have to ( like Anais Nin ) . Suggestions ? Or are there no well written smutty SF ? I just read _The Crow Road_ , by Iain Banks. it is not SF , but I think it would appeal to many SF readers. It has a number of sex scenes , some of which are hysterical. ( For those who have read the book : the two I have in mind are the one in the car , and the one near the end of the book. )
