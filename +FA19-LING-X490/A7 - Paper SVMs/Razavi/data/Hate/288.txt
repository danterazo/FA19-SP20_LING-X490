In addition , the theory he actually proposed turned out to be false. Wegner proposed that continents plough though the underlying bassalt and mantle. Thats incorrect : they float on it. Yah. But the plates push over and under each other. Wegner was sniffing out something that resembled the facts. Wegners case is an excellent example to aspiring etherialists. He wasnt taken seriously until 1 ) his proposed mechanism was physically plausible , and 2 ) it could be tested. Since LET makes all the same physical predictions of SR , etherialism is not , and fundamentall can not be , analogous to Wegners case. Now there is the main point. The Ether Boys do not offer an hypothesis of any added value , It does not predict any more effectively than non-ether theories. The usual complaint is that the non-ether theories arent physical and that they explain physical reality with equations. Bullshit ! The non ether theories predict the outcome of experiments and observations under stated conditions. The business of science is prediction , not finding the TRUTH. Bob Kolker
