# TODO, after SPR break III
- [] URGENT: finish hate speech list
    - look over manual tags again
    - 4 classes: not hate, mildly abusive, very abusive, ?
      - 0, 1, 2, n
    - abusive = you say if you want to hurt someone
- [] Figure out differences between R-imported and Python data
    - Unix `diff`. Save train from R, use `diff`, then compare two
- [] Ask Sandra to change delimiter (?)
- [] count how often people agree
    - consider collapsing mildly + very abusive
    - look at ones with low agreement
    - consider agreement rate, that determines how far we go
    - might have to do one last round
    - Wiegand was automatic, hence uncommon false flags
- [] add other TODO items from unsorted list


# 4-23 TODO

- up wordbank to get 10000 posts
- [x] write a script to get 10000 posts randomly from training set

    - [x] save 10000 posts to file + share. don't get 10000 random each time (one fixed random dataset)
